I’m in36mg now. I do wonder about trying adderall or vyvanse for the focus but so far methylphenidate has made a huge difference. I’m still going through some stages because I was diagnosed at 43 and my brain still hasn’t fully accepted the diagnosis after all these years. But as soon as the medication wears off it’s extremely apparent. It makes me drowsy and mellow when it kicks in and I get so much more done. Still hard to direct the focus beam but it’s much easier than before. \n\nCongrats. It’ll probably take some time adjusting and getting used to a late diagnosis. I still deal with some sadness thinking about broken relationships and not achieving more in life but at least we still have some time in front of us to still make positive changes."

I was actually a bit hyped but the next day it didn't work, felt a bit drowsy, I increased to 72mg for like 4 weeks but still nothing conclusive so we will stop this medication.

As well as my last trial on ADHD meds was a big flop. \n\nI can’t put all my eggs out in this one basket as it is, again, early days. But things feel so much improved which I didn’t think was possible because of how hard it’s been…well, my whole life it seems.\n\nAnyway, drink your water, move your body even if it’s just you thrashing on the floor.

Instead, I am much more aware of when it wears off now, which is helpful to allow myself the grace.\n\nI'm not sure if this was your first time taking the drug or the first time after a while (the syntax of your comment was a little confusing there), but regardless I'd say give it a couple of days and chat with your doctor; you might need a higher dose. The dosage of my pills (technically a generic Concerta) went up in 10mg increments and I went as high as 50 before settling back down to 40. Your milage may (probably will) vary."

I mentioned to the psychiatrist in my followup that I had some brain fog and a hard time thinking. He increased the concerta to 27mg and higher dose of trileptal and I noticed that it makes my brain fog worse. I stopped taking the tripeptal and noticed it helped my brain fog. I have a follow-up tomorrow and I'll ask to either bump the concerta again to try vyanse but depending on what should be done with the tripeptal to get rid of the brain fog.\n\nOverall very happy with the additional energy and anxiety but didn't really help with my inattentiveness where someone can talk to me and I still will start thinking about it and miss the conversation bc I'm in my head. I know it'll take time to fine tune my meds bc I'm only 2 months into the journey and am glad to be start it!\n\nLet me know if that helps."

My symptoms were better, I didn't have insomnia anymore, I felt really peaceful, and no drug side effects (which is rare for me). Then the generic came out and I started having migraines, maybe from the inactive ingredients. Now I'm on Adderall generic XR and it's helpful, but I definitely don't get that peaceful feeling and still need to push myself to begin tasks.

Not sure if it was just me but I forgot to ask if coffee was fine so I massively limited my intake, I was then told my usual 3/4 cups (of standard strength I'm sure) a day is fine, this is probably one of the big reasons I had headaches all the time. Always good to check anything you're unsure of though!\n\n\\- Watch your eating habits, I struggle most days with making sure I'm eating enough (VERY unusual for me before Concerta), if you start struggling with appetite loss I would suggest meal replacement shakes like Huel, makes it easier\n\n\\- If you can, whether it be a therapist, a friend or whoever, talk through the experience, it's a lot of change and it can feel overwhelming/confusing at times\n\n\\- I believe it's supposed to take around 3 weeks to see better how you're doing on that dosage/medication so if not much happens straight away, don't worry\n\n\\- Take your blood pressure (you can get one for £20 on Amazon if you want to do it at home) and measure your weight fairly regularly, I was told to by my psychiatrist, I try to take them every 2/3 weeks\n\n\\- I keep the pills and breakfast bars by my bed so that I ensure I take them about the same time and there's food in case I'm not ready to get up yet (and water of course)\n\n\\- Make sure to report back to your psychiatrist if you have any concerns or side effects that you're struggling with, it'll help them assess your dosage and will be able to advise\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince it's easy to get hyped up with all good/helpful changes (especially the first couple months), it's good to remember that it'll settle into a new sort of normality; it's easy to forget here and there that the medication doesn't magically fix things (I needed reminding a month or so in!).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope all goes well!"

So I would say make sure you’re eating!!! I did also notice today a headache around the 8hr mark, but it’s just from going back on it and shouldn’t stick 🤣\n\nOne thing though I will always pay attention to now is my caffeine intake. I remember my doctor told me 10 years ago that I could either take my concerta or drink energy drinks. At 19 I chose the energy drinks 🤣🤦🏻‍♀️"

    "comment": "Started Concerta 3 days ago, also 18 mg.\n\nHonestly I didn't feel much on 18 mg. A slight tingly sensation 30-40 minutes in on day 1. A very slight increased ability to focus maybe. Got a slight headache after a few hours but it went away completely after taking Ibuprofen.\n\nWhen it left my system I felt slightly hotter than usual, especially in the face. I also felt a bit \"off\" in the body, hard to describe, but felt like a very light fever can feel.\n\nStepped up to 36 mg today since 18 mg wasn't doing anything (agreement with psych). Definitely felt more there.\n\nDuring the first few hours I felt it did too much actually, my heart rate increased slightly and I got anxious, to the point where it was counter-acting the medication and leaving me less able to focus because the anxiety was too much in the foreground. However after the first few hours the anxiety subsided and I felt normal, with higher focus but not to the point I probably want to end up at.\n\nToday was first experience of 36 mg, will continue that until I don't get the anxiety or overwhelming response described above, then my psych thinks I should go to 54 mg.\n\nWill see what happens with time.\n\nAnyways I wouldn't be scared of 18 mg, it's not a dose likely to cause severe side effects or problems and certainly not a place where you need to be afraid of addiction (if you follow your psychs orders).\n\nConcerta is a serious drug, especially because it can affect your heart and blood pressure, so you need that monitored.\n\nIt can technically be abused, but Concerta is probably the least viable for abuse of the stimulant options because it is a slow release tablet, doesn't mean you can't do it, but it isn't instant release like Ritalin or Adderall so it won't be the same experience."

    "comment": "I can relate to your experience. I felt almost nothing in the first two to three days. I took my first pill on a Friday I think, or maybe a Thursday, and I felt nothing for the weekend, not even negative side effects like sleepiness. Maybe coffee was making my heart a little, which it doesn't do usually. ‘I must have been misdiagnosed, the search for what's wrong in my life continues’, is what I was thinking.\n\nOn Monday, I started noticing a few differences, but nothing in your face, no ‘the cloud open and you're bathed in glorious sunlight’ moment. But yeah, I noticed a few differences.\n\n- I have a meditation course on Mondays. Normally, it feels like a rodeo: as there's no external stimulation, my mind takes this as an opportunity to race off in every direction, and I spend my while meditation noticing that I've lost track _again_ and need to recenter. On stimulants, it's a much gentler experience, my mind slowly drifts and I can keep my mind more or less centered with gentle tugs, if that makes sense\n- I have a monthly course in feminist philosophy. Normally it's absolutely exhausting and I don't remember all that much. It's super hard for me to read along with the prof (her voice interferes with my reading). This time I was able to follow along, that was awesome.\n- In everyday life, I find it easier to break through that wall that comes every time I need to make a decision. It's easier to get out of bed. It's easier to stop doom scrolling. It's easier to decide what to make for dinner. I used to inspect my fridge and cupboards in agony, waiting in agony for inspiration to strike. Even choosing what to order from Über Eats was painful. Now it's easier for me to just go ‘oh, there’s leftovers I can reheat’ or ‘I'll just cook _insert staple food here_’\n\nI still wasn't sure if it really was the meds, so I had a two day break (without asking my psychiatrist, not sure how reckless that was 😅), and yup, my indecisive, scatterbrained self was back.\n\nI would say, when cruising, my brain feels about the same as before, but I don't run out of juice every time I need to accelerate or drive up a hill like I used to.\n\nI have a friend who started Adderall about the same time I started Concerta. It was helping with her ADHD symptoms, but also giving her anxiety that was even more disabling, so, her quest for the right medicine and dosage continues.\n\nI hope you find what works for you soon 🫂"

It did cause a bit of a commotion, they started by saying they'd need to back order my drugs, and then they remembered that they had been keeping some for a person who had failed to collect it, so they gave it to me.\n\nI also live in France, I don't know how relevant the supply situation over here is for somebody living, say, in the States. I'm going out on a limb here, but I'm not sure you can get Adderall here at all. I've been told methylphenidate (Concerta / Ritalin) is the only approved stimulant medication for ADHD in France.\n\nI'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful.

Felt more productive and motivated than I remember being for the longest time.\n\nAlso automatically did things that I usually would struggle to do, like clean up after myself, take out the trash, etc. It came naturally which it absolutely never did before so that is a huge change.\n\nWent shopping and got a lot done, and had a great desire to get even more done. Was also a lot more able to calmly focus on multiple tasks without getting overwhelmed, so while I was waiting for the bus I called the pharmacy to get some prescription paper work done and more like that. Normally I would need to focus so much on the transport I would be unable to handle such at the same time.\n\nStill felt some of the feelings of yesterday, but not nearly as bad and instead the prevailing feeling was one of energy, motivation and a natural ability to do things which I never had before."

It's to get your body used to it and see if there are any bad side effects immediately obvious.\n\nMost people will need a higher dose for their ADHD symptoms to be adequately counteracted.\n\nI think most of us seek validation and comfort in the experiences of others. I know I do, probably because of how much the psychs and pharmacists I talked to drilled me on side effects and health effects of the stimulants. Taken various medications through my life and ADHD meds are definitely the most monitored and involved I've had to take, so I know I personally feel the need to mirror my experiences in others a bit."

Normally, it's agonizing for me to decide what I'll make for lunch or dinner, today I was able to make the decision without much fuss.\n\nI was able to have a relaxed play at a video game this evening, that hasn't happened in a long while.\n\nAs for side effects, a little bit of a headache (not actually a full-blown headache, just a bit of tension around the scalp and the temples), and I had the feeling that my heart was racing a little bit. Nothing crazy, but I felt a little more present than usual.\n\nNot sure which part of it is placebo / nocebo, and which part is the Concerta doing a thing.\n\nEither way, no experimenting for me, I'm stuck with 18 mg per day for 4 weeks (except if things go badly in which case I can stop)."

    "comment": "Hmm, so, I'm still on concerta a few months later.\n\nBasically, what happened is, my psychiatrist doubled my prescription after the first month unprompted. I can now take a 18 mg pill in the morning, and another 18 mg pill at noon. Maybe he got me started on a really low dosage as a safeguard against side effects?\n\nI find the noon pill to be more important than the morning pill.\n\nThe effects are still fairly subtle, but they're there. It's easier for me to stay focused during boring meetings (not easy, just easier). I fidget less when I'm on my pills than when I'm not.\n\nMy depression is slowly getting better. I'm not sure if this is thanks to the antidepressants I've been on for about a year, or to talk therapy, or to the Concerta making it possible for me to get shit done without it being excruciatingly hard.\n\nI'm able to work again (I've had to stop for several months because I was just mentally exhausted).\n\nI've also come out, including to myself, as non binary. Not sure if coming out is making me feel better, or if feeling better made it possible for me to come out, but... Things are moving, which feels scary but also good.\n\nNo lightbulb moment, no clouds parting and riding off into the sunset, just work. But when I work, it does something now, whereas I felt so fucking helpless and useless before.\n\nIt's a bit like riding an e bike... Or even just finding the right gear on a regular bike TBH. I still have to push the pedals, but I feel like I'm getting results out of it instead of just struggling myself to death.\n\nWell, and that being said, I still need to shop for Christmas presents 😬 Concerta is no silver bullet for me 😅\n\nI'd like to know how it goes for you. If you ping me in an update, I'll be happy to read it.\n\nOh, also, be prepared for all kinds of nonsense how this is doping, or cheating, or you don't really need stimulants, or they're going to ruin your health or you don't really have ADHD.

You’re unable to get this medication prescribed in Russia but (and I know this as I lived there for three months last year, and my boyfriend is Russian) but I was able to take a months’ supply with me. \n\nHOWEVER - I was very thorough with the process beforehand. We had both the private and NHS prescriptions translated into Russian and legalised. In addition, you are supposed to declare narcotics of any amount at the border (this list is far greater than what we have here in the U.K., and I had other medications on me) and this process took forever. \n\nI was seeing a fairly good, well respected, family doctor after the first month. I could not get Elvanse and was prescribed something very weird I cannot remember the name of (I wasn’t expecting to be there longer than three weeks).\n\nAlso - it’s possible to get methylphenidate on prescription in Egypt I think? Adderall is definitely banned though. From some Googling it looks as though you can take your own methylphenidate prescription in \n\nTLDR: you cannot get them prescribed in Russia at ALL, but you are not banned from entering the country with them with a translated and legalised prescription"

I've been wanting to travel to Japan and Korea whenever I get the money (and it's safe to do so) but since being prescribed with Ritalin I've been a bit worried and found a lot of the information hard to understand. So this is super helpful!\n\nAlso Australia wasn't noted but here's some information! [https://www.odc.gov.au/travellers](https://www.odc.gov.au/travellers)\n\n* Proof of prescription or a letter from your doctor listing the medication(s) you're carrying have been prescribed to you. Also needs to include the name of the medication and dosage. \n* The medication needs to remain in its original packaging with the dispensing label intact. \n* Can only bring 3 months worth, if you need more you'll need to consult with an Australian registered doctor for additional medication once you've arrived in Australia. \n* **Declare all medication to Australian Border Force upon arrival**."

It's basically like a Visa for your meds and you need to apply for it in advance.\n\nThere's not much detail here but there's a few links if you need more: https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs"

I organized and run our household, keep things tidy and clean.\n\nIt's not perfect, and it doesn't work the same way every day... It depends on a lot of factors like sleep which I still sometimes struggle with.\n\nIt was also hard work to figure out my dose and timings... It was over a year of daily logging, failing, crying, wanting to give up, doubting the meds etc. I'm not going to lie, I went through a serious depressive episode because my meds worked instantly for a month and then they didn't suddenly and I couldn't figure out why for a while. If it wasn't for my partner I wouldn't have stuck with it and did the necessary fine tuning adjustments and show the patience necessary.\n\nIn the it was worth it and improved my life in many many ways and I'll be eternally grateful to both my doctor and my partner.\n\nI'd say give it a go, you only have one chance at life and if you think you can benefit from it, trying it and failing is preferable over not doing it, wondering and regretting.

heading to my doctor's appt to tell him that, i realised i wasn't 30 mins late like usual (to my 1hr appt), and as i was talking, i started to realise some of what i was saying didn't feel fully

looking down and rocking and barely getting a word out. he increased my dose a bit, and as i headed back after the appointment i ran into a stranger with her daughter asking for directions. i didn't speak the language, but i gave them some directions and left. a couple mins later i realised I'd given them the wrong directions, and usually, i'd feel guilty about it all day but be frozen to do anything about it in the moment. instead, i just walked back and found them, and walked them 15 mins to their destination with google maps bcs it was hard to explain the way with the language barrier and they didn't have internet.\n\nbefore that day, even getting out of bed, brushing my teeth, eating, showering, everything, just living really, felt like too much effort and not worth it.\n\nas i got home, i had the passing thought that i should call my mom since it'd been weeks since i picked up her calls or texted her, and then i did it. usually, going from thought to action would take hours of agonising and then not actually happen. this time, i just did it. and when i hung up, i was alone in the room, and it just struck me how quiet it felt. no 30 mixed songs playing over each other, 5 random phrases repeating, 20 more thoughts crashing into each other in my head. just so much quieter until i chose to have a thought. i could go from one thought to the next. i honestly almost cried.\n\ni was supposed to talk to my doctor in a week, but i only went back over a month later. he was so worried, but then so shocked at how well i seemed to be doing. he genuinely thought I'd killed myself or something, and was so sad that nothing had worked at this point, but when he saw me, and heard that i actually went on a trip with friends, he was shocked. he was laughing incredulously. he had never expected an improvement like this.\n\ni started doing a lot better at uni as well, it was unfortunately too little too late, and my enrollment eventually ended up getting terminated. but i found a different uni doing a different program, actually got in, and love it so much. im doing so much better here. i am still sometimes late and sometimes miss classes and I'm also not super consistent with meds, but I'm actually doing so well. straight As, finally getting my work done on time, not missing so many classes that i fail classes for absences even if i do still miss some days.\n\ni still have bad times sometimes. my room is a garbage dump again, i still struggle to do laundry often sometimes, I'm social but not super social, I'm not very physically healthy, but I can actually see a path forward where these things will also get better. for the first summer ever i will have finished all my assignments by the end of the semester, no extensions that hang over my head the whole summer. i will finally clean and organise my room and then try to keep it that way. i will have a regular schedule next semester even if i don't have class at the same time everyday, take my meds more consistently, cook more often instead of ordering takeout so much and wasting money, try to get more freelance work (which I've already been doing some which is a crazy thought considering where i was before), start going the the gym, and make more social plans myself, and the thing is i can actually see myself doing these things now. and a lot of this has to do with meds. living with friends is a big part of it as well, but the meds also enabled me to participate in life more and engage with my roommates and get closer to friends and so on. honestly for me they did so much, and it's not the same for everyone, but for some people and those who are really not managing to even survive, they can be a lifesaver."

They definitely helped with all aspects of life, or rather my ADHD was indeed affecting all of the categories you mention:\n\n- My career improved, I struggle less with \"unpleasant\" tasks and I'm more organized in general, which directly translates to better results and honestly just plain more enjoyment of work because I'm actually good at what I do\n\n- Relationships improved because I stopped being constantly burnt out, and had more energy/motivation/time to actually devote to my partner and family\n\n- Motivation, well, it's not a night/day difference, but it's there. It's like a +25% on whether I successfully get off my ass and do stuff I aim to do, which depending on your perspective can be life changing nonetheless.\n\n- Mental health & confidence - oh yes. I realized over time I stopped being so constantly self-doubting, and instead became a lot more \"natural\" when dealing with people.\n\n- Financial stability - kinda? Maybe more so bureaucratic stuff, like filling out my taxes, taking my car to the mechanic, etc. Health not so much, still working on that one haha, I *will* one day start working out, I'm sure.\n\nI'm not a different person, and it's not like my problems were erased, but it's a big difference still. I guess it's like wearing glasses or something? In its respective area it's a huge difference, and that translates to a lot of indirect improvements, but you're still you, if that makes sense.

My life hasn't significantly changed yet, but there's definitely some subtle improvements that I'm sure gonna have a positive effect in the long run, mainly the fact that now when I'm stressed out about stuff, I just do something about it, even if it means working on something over a long course of time. Before meds I was always stressed out about problems that would likely arrise in the future, but couldn't get myself to do anything about it and just did stuff to escape from my worries instead. As a result, I feel less useless now and I'm starting to believe in myself again. I feel like whatever happens, I'll be able to deal with it, while before taking  meds, I was in a constant state of being overwhelmed by every possible problem that I might have to deal with someday, and because of avoiding discomfort instead of dealing with anything, it just kept building up. I still have a long way to go to get my life back on track after avoiding dealing with problems all my life, but, I'm getting there slowly but surely."

    "comment": "Audhd'er here. When I started taking medication, I was blown away by the immediate improvement in my ability to focus, and do tasks that normally I just couldn't make myself do. I have far less anxiety. I have far better emotional regulation. I probably wouldn't have my current relationship without it.  My head doesn't race all night. I don't have a kazililion thoughts going at the one time. I don't have repeating intrusive phrases going in my mind.\n\nIf I was in a career that I wanted to be in, I think I'd get a lot more benefits from the medication and would be smashing life right now. I wish I had the medication back when I was doing something that meant a lot to me, but that was a long time ago. I'm looking for another job. Currently I can still only work part time and not become dysregulated and depressed. That has a significant financial cost. I recently had a couple of weeks off work and the surge in my emotional wellbeing and cognitive ability was mind blowing.  I know that if I was doing my own (creative) work that my wellbeing would greatly improve as I tend to have a vast amount of energy for my own work. Anyhow, I'm working on that.\n\nBecause the impact of medication on my mental health and focus was so great, I did expect it to bring a massive turnaround in my life as I've always been ambitious, driven and for the right project, very hard working.  I anticipated a sudden upswing in success etc. But I got diagnosed so late, many of my great lifetime opportunities have been well and truly lost years ago and there's not really a way back into those fields for me now. And I think I've grieved them and moved on.  I now find that I have to put financial security above everything as I'm at an age now where a big risk could wipe me out, without time to catch up. I do feel like my parachute has opened pretty fucking late. I could easily hit the ground anyway. That being said, I'm still looking at how I can pursue something meaningful and satisfying again now.\n\nTwo years in, I can see that I need to take a job that is a lot simpler. I get turned down for many jobs for being overqualified or coming across as too knowledgeable or too intellectual for the job. I usually cut most of my CV out to get jobs. I'm hoping to get a receptionist job, for my mental health and happiness. I have an irrefutable ceiling on some abilities. Time to accept it.\n\nSince medication I've spent a lot of time working on getting my house in order.  My house has gone from messy and not very clean, to immaculate and minimalist. I still have some junk to get rid of that's in storage. There is still a fair bit of financial neglect to rectify. Tax stuff. I'm still very financially insecure and am still floating around being very bright, hard working and determined, but in the wroooong place. My peers are now almost ready to retire. Most are wealthy or at least very well off and have done the things they wanted to do. None of us grew up wealthy but everyone has done very well. I have a very small window of years now to create financial security for myself. I'll give it a red hot go. I work a lot on radical self acceptance, meditation etc. and try not to freak the fuck out.\n\nI've developed a tolerance for vyvanse and am experimenting with an increased dosage. I think I need to take 50% more now. I'm not sure what happens if/when I become even more tolerant of it. Hopefully it'll be ok. \n\nEdit: I think if I can wangle my way into a creative situation, I think there's still a good chance of achieving some of the things I've wanted to."

    "comment": "Yes I think it’s changed my life dramatically but it’s not an instantaneous fix, I have to still put in a lot of energy to improve all facets of my life but now it’s much much easier to do so.\n\n- Career: I lose focus easily, am extremely unorganized, I have a lot of anxiety from my mind racing constantly and the meds helped calm all that down so I can focus better at work and make a schedule to keep everything of mine organized which has improved work.\n\n- relationships: SO much better. Such dramatic improvement that I can’t believe I went 26 years of my life undiagnosed. The biggest impact my adhd has on me is my ability to emotionally regulate, forgetfulness, and impulsivity. Like I would forget what I was saying mid sentence, my mind would go blank from anxiety, and any perceived negative reaction made me extremely upset with myself and ugh it was awful. With meds, my extreme anxiety and impulsivity is basically non existent so now I can’t actually function like a normal human and not worry/freak out/have a breakdown over everything, and I don’t have the brain fog that kept me from constantly forgetting what I was saying mid sentence..Which of course has dramatically improved my relationships and my ability to make and keep friends\n\n- motivation & achieving goals: it doesn’t do much for me in this realm because I’m normally a very ambitious person and try to see things through the end, but I’d say that meds help me keep a clear mind so I can sit down, plan out my day & time spent on things, and focus on whatever I’m doing without distraction. I’d say my goals are achieved a bit quicker now.\n\n- mental health/confidence/anxiety. It’s been absolutely life changing and I’m absolutely mot the same person I was a year ago. I’m much more confident because I’m not ruminating or anxious about everything 24/7, I can ground myself much easier now, and mental health has improved but I still need to make sure I’m keeping all the systems i built up over the years to keep my mental health in check. I’d say mental health is still a daily struggle but it’s nowhere near as bad & it’s much more manageable since I have an easier time keeping my emotions regulated\n\n- financial stability: I’m not impulse shopping anymore :) I had a really really bad shopping addiction, like I was still buying random shit even though I didn’t really fully want it, I just wanted the high that came with getting something new for myself. Unfortunately I’m working 2 jobs now to fix my finances from my spending addiction, but I’ll take this + being medicated over being unmedicated and very impulsive any day of the week"

Whe I take Adderall i feel im locked in and think clearly without any bluuuur or constant ruminateing. Ive started taking it two times in the morning and one in the afternoon but to get the consistent affect has been a chellenge. To me it's about timing and what I've eaten and how well im hydrated. I make sure to eat a pretty good meal before taking Adderall. In the morning im assuming i still have the seroquil in my system so it might be waking me up From that. Also what Ive experienced it helps to be very hydrated. Ive been taking amino acid and electrolytes powder with chia seeds mixed in water and its made a difference.

    "comment": "**Did your life change significantly before vs after meds?**\n\nYes, profoundly, in my opinion. After about 6 months or so, I actually realized what being medicated was doing for me.\n\nDid they help with things like:\n\n**Career or school success**: I started actually doing work instead of sitting around all the damn time. *Everyone* noticed this. I was a manager, so I was \"managing\" but I could never find it in me to jump in and help if it wasn't *absolutely necessary*. Suddenly, I was jumping in, helping out, learning new things and expanding my knowledge at work. It really helped me become liked by the employees rather than hated.\n\n**Relationships or marriage**: My girlfriend is happy that I have been able to *mostly* stick to routines and my room has actually been kept clean for over a year now. I can do chores more easily, although I still have my bad days where my meds don't fully activate or I'm not doing well mentally because of my job. But I would usually have a cycle where my room would pile up and get junky and then several months later, I'd finally clean it. Rinse and repeat. But now, I'm taking my trash out as soon as the trash can fills up and not letting several bags pile up, doing my laundry every 3-5 days instead of once every two or three weeks when I ran out of clean clothes, and I'm keeping the floor clean and clear of clutter.\n\n**Motivation and achieving goals**: Still have trouble with motivation, doesn't seem to have done much for this aspect if we're viewing this as motivation to achieve goals. I do have more motivation in general to just do *things*. Within the first three months of me taking Adderall/Ritalin, I got promoted to General Manager, and before I had started taking it, I would have never even been on a top 25 list to get promoted. Take that as you will.\n\n**Mental health, confidence, or anxiety**: I've discovered that my mental health revolves around how well I am doing at work. I don't think my Adderall does anything to help with this at all. For confidence and anxiety, I noticed a marked improvement in my social anxiety after starting guanfacine. Although, I did start doing weekly therapy with a new therapist late last year and I started the guanfacine at the same time, so I don't know if it's the meds or if its the therapy.\n\n**Even financial stability or health?** I've actually started focusing more on my health recently and because of Adderall, I can more easily overcome that executive dysfunction of having to set up appointments or call, or even go to appointments the day of. It's led to me getting a diagnosis of narcolepsy, actually going to therapy to get help, a colonoscopy that I was 6+ years overdue for, and being able to mostly keep routines is helping me with all of that as well. Financial stability? I'm not entirely certain I can thank Adderall for that. I started Zepbound last year and it has helped me not spend $1000s on DoorDash or eating out at restaurants.\n\nIt's been a net positive in my life and I am so glad that I didn't have to jump through hoops to get prescribed. I understand my \"diagnosis\" was odd and my doctor seems very \"pill happy\", but I got like 30mg of Adderall as my starting dose after just a 5 minute conversation with my psychiatrist who I had literally just met. I'm not a huge fan of him anymore because my follow ups are about 2-3 minutes over telehealth and he just asks, \"How's the Adderall doing? Okay, great, I'm sending 3 months to your pharmacy, see ya later!\" I think I timed one of my appointments at 1 minute 57 seconds. I plan on switching to a new psychiatrist because I'd like to have one that I can talk to about my ADHD and not about my ADHD meds, if that makes any sense. I still have zero idea as to the nature of my ADHD, what type it is, how it actually affects me in my daily life, or anything like that. I've had to do my own research about ADHD and I'm also afraid that since I don't even have an ADHD assessment, that it could eventually prevent me from getting my meds in the future.\n\nIf I were to pinpoint any negatives about my ADHD meds, it's that it can definitely lead to impulsivity in a negative way. Before, I'd have executive dysfunction and I wouldn't be able to make myself do something. But now, I can open that Amazon tab and order that thing that I don't need. I also take T for low testosterone which increases my sex drive and I think my ADHD meds allow me to indulge in that a lot more than I would have. Before I'd be horny and *think* about masturbating, but I wouldn't ever end up doing it. Now it's like I think about it and I do it - and I've probably done it more in the past year than the previous 2-3 years combined. I also sometimes feel like I rely too much on needing the Adderall to be able to do things. I know I'm not supposed to, but I would sometimes take extra if something important was happening (such as the big boss is doing a visit at work) or if I was tired because I didn't get any sleep. Even with this, though, I will sometimes forget to even take it after my first dose. After I get to work, I just go into work mode and forget that I have Adderall with me to take throughout the day. A lot of the time, I only end up taking 1 out of the 3 daily pills that I'm supposed to take.\n\nFinally, it actually helps me sleep better and more consistently. I fall asleep faster than I ever have before because I no longer have anxiety over feeling tired the next day. Adderall would take away any tiredness that I had, so I no longer had to worry about feeling like complete shit all day if I didn't get sleep. So taking away my anxiety over \"I have to sleep, I need to get to sleep, AAAAAA\" actually improved my sleep.\n\n**TL;DR: Yes. Adderall has changed my life and I am so happy that I was able to get prescribed this medication.**"

When I originally went to university, before deploying, I had a very difficult time focusing on things which I needed to do both academically and practically. My grades were excellent for courses I had an interest in, and passable (or terrible) for the ones I did not.\n\nAfter I got diagnosed and received medication during my final semester, it was a completely new story. I had a drive to do things which had previously eluded me and had a perfect semester GPA and made honor roll lol. My professors had all noticed a change, and one of them encouraged me to continue studying for a Master's degree. I ended up moving to Europe a year or so later, and fear of starting the medication process in a different country after the nightmare that was the American healthcare system left me unmedicated for a little over 2 years.\n\nIn that time, I've dealt with instability, inability to do things I \\*know\\* I can do and have the capacity for, and have grappled with a lot of other underlying issues both mental and physical. It's been grueling to be without the support medication provided me, especially because I \\*remembered\\* what I was missing. I just started it again this last month, and found it was wildly blown out of proportion in my mind in terms of how much effort needed to be made (and money spent) in contrast to in the U.S.\n\nI'm unsure what else will change going forward, but I do know medication will be very critical for me in the long-run."

I was tested the summer after year one in college and had ADHD. I was taught couping skills and put on XR adderall and I can say it changed everything. BUT I do feel it waa a combination of both. My basic life skills improved as well. I was no longer late and having issues getting up early and forgetting things I had scheduled.

My mood is more settled and my emotions are more regulated though I still have had some spirals. I am more motviated but only for hands on practical tasks like cleaning so far, not for anything that involves sitting still and focusing, like paperwork at work, unfortunately. My mind isn't quiet and I cant focus on one thing either. Other people have commented that i seem calmer, quieter and more present even before i noticed it.

Cautiously optimistic, it’s helping and side effects seem light and manageable so far. \n\nBrain fog: I’d hoped that this would just go away and I’d feel clear like after the deepest sleep, but that’s not quite accurate. I hadn’t thought about it like this before, but the fog might have been the sensation of my attention being divided, and it’s the fog itself that is being focussed - like my consciousness was blurred and now it isn’t. Is this what people mean when they say meds is like putting on a pair of glasses? \n\nDon’t feel the need to drink alcohol or use nicotine - I’ve been hooked to nicotine replacement lozenges for decades, popping them like M&Ms when working. Next to no withdrawal. Chewing gum more than adequately replaces what must have been stimming behaviour and also helps with the dry mouth.\n\nBetter able to cope with stress and my heart doesn’t sink if I think about work outside of work. And dare I say it, I’m feeling happy. I don’t know how much of this is the Dumbo’s Feather effect, but I imagine that couldn’t last indefinitely so I’ll know soon enough\n\nEdit: I realise that I need to learn to harness this new gift of attention. If I get distracted, I can get reaaaally distracted, though it might be easier to break out of that so long as I realise that’s what’s happening. Also, whilst it’s easier to just crack-on with things, it won’t magically get you motivated to do something that you really don’t want to do. I have learned that it is possible to be lazy AND have ADHD - now I just know which behaviour is which and own the real laziness"

Saying that, I used to have all 3 types of insomnia (can’t fall asleep, can’t stay asleep, wake up too early) and I now only experience the last one. During the day, the effects are subtly there - I can think ‘right, time to do this’ and I do it, I can study for extended periods without getting out my phone, I can focus in lectures without my mind wandering. It’s honestly been a game changer for me. I’m currently trying supplements to improve my early waking and REM sleep (stimulants and SSRIs both can impact it, and I’m on both), and the meds are only so effective when I’m very sleep deprived; I still need to stick to a good wind down routine and keep good sleep hygiene. But overall, it’s been amazing, and I’m so happy I tried it out. We’ll see how working is like once I’ve graduated!\n\nIn terms of other factors - my psych put me on antidepressants to rule out anxiety before prescribing me stimulants. SSRIs did nothing and Elvanse has helped tremendously. I’m more confident, I ruminate less, I’m more decisive."

Although my brain is as are as IQ numbers, very high. But, I did not make it past 10th grade. Basically. I am an autodiotiac and mainly learn visually. \n\nI was glad the newer medications of recent years/decades helped my brain focus and become more productive, I was sad for a while about the years of confusion and harsh effects of the psychotropics but that is history now. Back then, in my early teens, first-generation psychotropic medicines were what was prescribed. Also, there are a few stats in psychiatric wards for observation and rx regulating. It was Hell. \n\nI try hard to monitor the side effects of adderall and am not always successful. I just forget that sometimes it's absolutely necessary, especially at my age. After cancer at 41, my body was forced into early menopause which created other problems, but fortunately, they were helped with bioidentical hormone pellets. My life has been night and day since these adhd meds, and I am grateful. It is worth the meds to live a fuller \"my life.\"\n\nMy son was thankfully diagnosed in his  early 20s. He has been able to have a very successful long-time career in IT. For this alone, I am very grateful for those diagnosed early and medicated properly. \n\nHowever, everyone is different and unique. So, what fits for one may not be for others. It's best if you can find a compationate MD or, in my case, a DO.\n\nJust because one pill feels great does not mean that without a physician's supervision, it is not a wise thing to do by yourself. For some, like my son, half of a 20 mg is good for the entire day, for others dosage is more/less. \n\nTry to avoid other excessive stimulation via drinks, etc. To get a true reading on any changes and/or side effects that could affect blood pressure, etc. \n\nI wish you success, clarity and peace of mind going forward."

I usually keep the meds just for work days and if I only skip a day or two, I can get myself back, with relatively little energy, to stay consistent with newly established routine. Day 4 or 5 without meds is usually when I start slipping and that comes through at work (when ive not been able to get the script filled)\n\nThe emotional regulation thing has been clutch too.

I begged my family doctor for years to get me tested for ADHD but she dismissed me and just prescribed Wellbutrin and anti-anxiety meds and chalked it up to perimenopause. 😠. Went to a private clinic and got the diagnosis, made sure to take the results to my family doctor and tell her that I wasn’t making it up all those years. As soon as I started meds, I realized how much it would have affected everything in my life if I had been diagnosed earlier. How much I had shut down the past few years because I was so overwhelmed by stress and literally locked myself in my apartment for 2.5 years. Had I started meds earlier, my life choices would have been massively different and treating the RSD finally has drastically improved my outlook. I’m not working at the moment, but now I can focus on moving things forward. I had some huge stressors in the past few months and being on meds allowed me to focus and stabilize myself emotionally. I find myself eager now to start working, not wasting time trying to get motivated.

I couldn't keep a full time job, manage my finances or relationships. which is why I had to figure my shit out. I'm also on the spectrum. Disordered thinking, emotional dysregulation, inattentiveness and impulsivity are my most dominant traits. My short-term memory is the shittiest.  \nI resisted medication because I thought I could figure how to cope with it on my own. My therapist convinced to just try and if it didn't work for me, no harm done. It gave me the relief and clarity I needed to do the work. I'm very lucky, I didn't have to try multiple medications, we figured out my correct dosage in about 6 months, and the side effects are manageable. I was able to reduce my mood disorder medication, my anxiety was greatly reduced, I just felt better. It's been years now. The combination of therapy, ADHD coaching, and medication has allowed me to finally achieve some dreams I once thought were impossible.   \nEven with interventions, there are moments when I have a brain glitch every day, but I can catch them now and refocus. My mood regulation is better, way fewer meltdowns. A mistake is no longer world shattering, sending me down into a self-destructive shame spiral. It still sucks but my perspective has changed now that I'm not so jumbled up. I stopped masking with friends and family and some coworkers. Turns out that I'm actually funny and nice. Who knew?  \nI came out to my bosses when I pursued a promotion last year because I felt they should know that the training process and future workflow was going to have to include accomodations. I never would have done that without all the previous successes behind me. Of course, they already knew, lol, but they were able to involve HR and make it all official. I never thought I would get the job but they saw how much my work and my relationships with co-workers had improved over the last few years. ADHD coaching was vital and my insurance covered some of the cost. I wish I could afford more. Some day.    \nMedication isn't magic.

I was definitely more productive when I was obsessively masking and trying my hardest. I was also more exhausted.\n\nI think I turned a corner perspective-wise as well—so again, nothing happens in a vacuum. I live a more relaxed and less stressed life now, but also in large part because I no longer try to go at everyone else’s pace.\n\nI can’t know how things would’ve turned out if I had kept going it alone without help. It seems like meds were indeed a big part of that and I don’t regret going/staying on them."

I don't feel I'm being pulled in a thousand directions at the same time anymore.\n- Work is tolerable, and I find it easier to start tasks and commit to them. \n- I'm way more aware of time. Days now seem consistent in length, and I can better estimate tasks. I can easily be on time for everything, and rarely get stuck in waiting mode. \n- I'm capable of better managing relationships, making plans and taking a genuine interest in people, and have more energy for socialising, I'm less in edge, and my  social Life has been getting increasingly fulfilling.\n\nNotes: it wasn't a straightforward process. I had to find my dosage, and I had to deal with secondary effects. My body became more adjusted to it eventually, though. And my habits started to better support it. Every person is different, but I find that the benefits of meds are greatly improved and the side effects greatly mitigated by: \n- regularly sleeping at least 8 hours.\n- keeping up with hydration.\n- eating enough protein (particularly for breakfast with the meds), and eating healthy in general.\n- exercising.\n- I also take magnesium supplements, and it seems to help me prevent muscle and joint pain, which was the main problem I had with the meds at the start."

I have never ever ever felt like it does anything for me but help me wake up a little in the morning. I can’t focus better, can’t remember more, can’t stay in task, can’t do anything better than I did before the meds. I recently told my psych this too and his solution was to add adderall on top of my Vyvanse. I told him I don’t like the way adderall makes me feel but he wanted me to try it again. I did. It sent me into the worst depressive episode I’ve ever had. So no I don’t notice a positive difference. I was just diagnosed with autism though so I’m thinking maybe I was misdiagnosed with ADHD"

I'm able to focus better, get the up and go juice easier, my symptoms aren't as debilitating anymore, and I'm just overall happier. \n\nI'm also on five other meds that help with my moods and other symptoms, though. So, I'm also gonna go over how those have helped as well, just to paint a better picture. \n\nMy lexapro has helped with my MDD a lot. I don't get depressed, my moods are more stable, and I'm able to enjoy life.\n\nMy trazadone (or however you spell it) has improved my sleep SO much. I'm able to fall asleep quickly, stay asleep longer; and if I do wake up, I'm able to go back to sleep easier. \n\nMy abilify have made my anxiety go from a 15/10 (daily) to a 7/10. It's made me less anxious all around. From my general anxiety to my social anxiety and even just normal anxiety. \n\nMy Buspar has made that 7/10 to a 5/10. It's also helped with my overall anxiety, but mainly my social anxiety and the paranoia that I seemed to have developed from having untreated anxiety for about 60-70% of my life. \n\nMy testosterone, while not intended for my moods, has helped me be overall more happy, too. T had helped me in so many ways that I couldn't leave it out. Of course, it's helped me in my transition, but, again, it's helped with my moods, my self-image, and just my overall look on life. \n\nThis got a bit long, but I figured since we were talking about meds, it would be good to include the others I take that help with my moods and other things I experience."

In my opinion, truly life changing.\n\nI take 25mg xr in the morning and 20mg IR in the afternoon.\n\nPhysically, I'm no longer tired and dragging all the time. It used to eel like I was physically walking through water or mud all the time and moving my body was just tiring. Now I feel like I did when I was a kid and actually have energy, which makes it easier for me to get up and do stuff or makes me excited to get out of the house, rather than needing to stay home and recharge so often.\n\nI found out that I'm really good at my job! I'm a special Ed teacher, and now I feel way more engaged with my students. I don't feel the need to sit down all the time. I put so much more time into thoughtful lessons and getting my paperwork done on time is SO MUCH EASIER. I still struggle sometimes with completing all paperwork and small stuff, bit it's overall way better.  I also feel much more confident at my job. Like, I know that I'm a really good teacher and I can see it and feel it, and I get really good feedback from admin.\n\nSometimes it's still hard to start tasks, but once I do I'm able to stick with it for much longer. My task and focus stamina has inxreqsed significantly and I feel like I can hyper fixate on things thst, in thr past, I would have struggled to do at all.\n\nDoing chores rewards my brain (but only when my meds are actively working). I feel satisfaction now from doing dishes or cleaning. Before it was such an unfulfilling task that brought no satisfaction or reward and felt like torture. I now have more pride in cleanliness and keeping up with things.\n\nI didn't realize i had anxiety before I took meds. I used to feel extreme stress and disappointment in myself for dropping the ball for something at work, or not doing really important things. Every week I'd have multiple events where I'd feel really anxious and it would make me feel irrationally angry and depressed and stressed. But in the 5 years since starting my meds, I have only experienced anxiety like 2 or 3 times.\n\nBut of course things aren't perfect. I still struggle to get motivated, complete tasks, and to do less preferred tasks. This affects my relationship a lot. My wife doesn't trust me to finish or do things that I say I will do. And I feel awful for it and I hate how I disappoint her and sometimes I feel like I'm going to lose her because of it, but I dont know what to do. But I'm still in a better position than I was before because I recognize those challenges and I truly want to make positive changes to be better for us as a family."

I grew up in a home where there was a mix of folk of varying abilities (seriously it’s harder to type this story when you limit my verbiage of descriptors). I thought I was normal. So when I learned that I wasn’t, I was able to understand why my children were struggling so much more than I did. I had a mother that could regulate her emotions and learned to imitate her. My children were learning to imitate my imitations. When I understood this, I immediately took action to get my children more resources and became much more understanding of their struggles and how to tackle them.\n\nWith my husband, he had ADHD. I was unfairly judging him in ways that I had been taught to judge. I also couldn’t understand why my family saw him as a bad person, and why they would not change their opinion of him. When I started researching what it meant to have ADHD, I was able to understand a lot of the nuance behind my family’s very unfair judgements, and was able to shed the last of my own internalized opinions on those judgements. \n\nTheir judgements had always been levied against me as well. I had grown up very withdrawn and oppressed. The longer I lived with my husband, the more I discovered my true self, and the more my family grew to despise me as well. He was a bad influence on me. They never said it to my face, but it was implied. My diagnosis and discovery of what that meant freed me from decades of pain I never knew I had. It was the last push I needed to drop the shackles holding me back.\n\nI was never an anxious person. But I never really knew myself. My confidence has been growing since my marriage, but it’s at an all time high now that I have answers I never knew I needed.\n\nI have been healing in emotional ways too. I’m less angry, less judgmental, less frustrated, more playful. I feel more like myself. Like discovering a long last friend I thought I’d never see again."

I had a very valuable and prestigious education, that I barely made it through, but couldn’t really put it to use.  I would describe myself to others as lazy.  My parents considered me a constant source of disappointment.  \n\nAfter being unemployed during the GFC for 18 months, I finally landed a job and got engaged. I was almost 30 and I knew I had to change something. The job was too good to fuck up and I didn’t want to be unemployed again and unable to contribute to my family.  So I went on Adderall XR.  \n\nIt was like a switch flipped.  I realized pretty quickly that I could do boring repetitive tasks I usually avoided and I could stay organized and stop losing stuff. I started enjoying my work. I did so well in my new job, I stayed with the company for 12 years. It was one of the top companies in my industry and I became one of their most valuable employees.  One year I negotiated a 20% raise(really).  Instead of being bored I just grabbed every opportunity and ran with it.  It really felt like I was finally doing the quality of work of which I was capable.  I turned that into another job at a top tier place and now I have my own small consulting business.  I never thought I’d be able to work for myself, but here we are. \n\nIt helped me address so many other personal  problems too. When I saw that I could be successful at work, I started taking on stuff I avoided. I fixed my credit.  I got out of debt.  I started really saving for retirement. My wife and I were able to move to a nicer apartment.  I started exercising regularly(that one is still tough but I’ve mostly stuck to it).I am in the process of getting my teeth fixed after avoiding the dentist for years and years.  We got a dog because I wasn’t worried I’d forget to take care of it or get overwhelmed.  \n\nIt wasn’t magic.  I also had lots of CBT and trauma therapy to help me process my awful childhood and abusive parents.  But I probably never would have done any of that without ADHD meds."

But it’s so worth that trade off. \n\nIn terms of career and financial success, I would say it’s been a great tool.

I took our \"stand,\" and I panicked. Horribly. My mind went totally blank, I rambled for a couple minutes about AB10, and I got up and bolted. I cried in a stairwell; I tried to go back in; and I couldn't. \n\n\nAnd I did. My professor spoke to me about it and gave me a second chance that I asked him for; he let me bring a pen up to the stand with me to play with; I let myself study and practice (and, god, I had the patience to practice; I had the patience to let myself try to retry without beating myself up so harshly over it); and I sat down at the stand, stated my name and university, and it was like everything... melted. It was perfect. I went over my time, but I knew everything I was talking about, and I got a near perfect score. \n\n\nIn years past, I would have just taken a failing grade and said little to no words for the remainder of the semester. I wouldn't have gone to our celebratory hockey game, either. And I did. For the first time in my life, I was out of my head enough to let myself try-- and to let myself enjoy things. I was calm enough to focus on my quant labs and let someone else talk while I searched for components of gasoline; I was calm enough to get through my family's horrible, arrest-laden Christmas; I was okay, for the first time in my life. It wasn't a breeze, but it was easy. For the first time, I knew I was as smart as everyone said I was. I was mature, my Meemaw told me (in a random Publix parking lot? Right before we found out someone got arrested? Crazy. Wild). \n\n\nIt's not like it was a cure all. I'm still me. I'm still an anxious mess. I still find myself defaulting to things like \"Oh, he hates me\" when literally anything happens-- but it's so much easier to push it aside. It's easier to keep up on friendships, on work, on my family relationships. It's easier to find a place in new parts of my family. And I have a job! I got promoted! It's not in my field, but I use the skills I got from my degree all the time, and I know my limits, and I know I'm capable! I can feel the difference, being on them versus being off. I can run things. I'm large and in charge, man. I don't think I coukd have done it before. Or, if I had, it would have been so. Much. Harder."

    "comment": "I've been put on many things for ADHD since I was 5 years old. The ones I actually remember are Concerta and Strattera. I took Concerta from ages 8 to 20, but around 16 I started \"not taking\" them and throwing them in the trash and just not taking them at all during the summer (which I convinced my parents to let me do). I honestly never noticed any effect. I could stop taking it cold turkey and nothing would happen. I was no different with or without it. My parents switched me to strattera when I was 15 and it made me extremely depressed in a harmful way, so that didn't last long. \n\nA couple of years ago I decided to try Vyvanse. I did some research on it and thought it could be helpful. I decided to start taking meds again because I just felt off. Having been on it for the past couple of years, it has made my world way more clear and colorful.\n\n\\- In terms of career and school, I have had the same job for almost two years now and I decided to go back to school. I'm still finding challenges with returning to school, but I'm hopeful once I work out the kinks and get back into a normal routine, I'll do better.\n\n\\- In terms of relationship or marriage there has been no effect. My BPD makes sure of that. \n\n\\- In terms of motivation and achieving goals, I actually want to complete things. I don't always wait until the last minute, but when I do I get everything done and I make sure it's done well. I have been doing good at setting up boundaries for myself and making sure the goals I'm setting are for me and no one else. Like I want to go back to school for me, not my parents. \n\n\\- In terms of mental health/confidence/anxiety, I fear that cannot be fixed with ADHD medication. I've got a few comorbidities. So any effect my medication could have on those things, I would never feel or notice.\n\n\\- In terms of financial stability, I have credit cards again and I've been working hard to make sure they are paid off or paid on time instead of letting them go to collections like I've done in the past. I actively try to save money and create tools to help me do so. \n\nIn terms of health, I've lost 30 or so pounds? But that is most likely due to the Vyvanse helping to  control my compulsive eating/binge-eating, which was one of the deciding factors on taking Vyvanse. I drink way more water, but my eating habits have honestly not changed much- I just eat a normal amount now. \n\nI noticed positive changes most significantly a year into taking Vyvanse and they have been steadily keeping course."

    "comment": "Definitely have helped me the past 12 months since being medicated, managed to lose 20kg. \nStarted eating clean, listening to self help podcasts\nAlso have been running a business for 10 years, which was pretty unorganised as well as being unmotivated.\nNow way more organised and estimated to have doubled my income just being able to apply myself to the jobs, without getting bored wanting to go home.\nAlso joined gym 3 months ago to double down on all the other positive changes I’ve made.\nPrior to the medication I had years of alcohol abuse, to manage the internalised symptoms of anxiety/overthinking and being overwhelmed by any tasks that need to be done that I just couldn’t bring myself to do.\nI’m still not perfect. But the way I see it is I have a 50/50 chance sometimes of me just doing the task as soon as it comes to mind, rather then procrastinating on it and getting stuck for 2 hours going in circles in my head, \nAnd if I’m doing half the things I need to do as well as better choices throughout the rest of my life it will compound pretty well. \nHave been sober for 3 years now. 2 years was without medication as I developed a pretty severe case of pancreatitis and was forced to quit drinking. \nBut the year of medication has helped me develop new coping skills, like going for a ride or to the gym. \nFor reference I Did 6 months on Concerta, \nWorked pretty well for me but I switched to Vyvanse as I heard it worked better for some, so I wanted to not leave any eggs in the basket so to speak, Vyvanse seems to work a little better for me, I also quit drinking caffeine as I noticed it was effecting the medication, as I’d drink too many throughout the day.\nSometimes I’d get imposter syndrome and think is it working etc, but then I look back on the past 12 months and the physical and mental shift has been huge. All the little things compound, it helps a lot but you have to point it all in the right direction. The first few months medicated I was just playing games etc, but that wasn’t a path I wanted to stay on.\nAlways wanted to get healthier for myself and my family so that has been my priority."

I'm worried if I'll be able go sustain my marriage or even be able to hold down a long term job, which i want to do but feel no motivation in my life. My only income is through the VA thankfully, but that's not enough to live on really. I just started taking amoexitine 40mg for two weeks and now moved up to 40mg twice a day. I have my doubts, but I'll try it. I don't like that it takes months to start working, my life is falling apart now! But it seems like it's always going to be to psychiatrists first diagnosis to prescribe non-stimulant medication. I have my seizures totally under control, and I don't have reactions to stimulants but which is what's annoying because I feel like I can't tell that to the psychiatrist or else they will just think I'm trying to get stimulant medicine. So hopefully I got it all wrong but I just don't feel the medicine working the way I need it to in the right way it should be for me. I might be wrong, time will tell over the next month while I take the new dosage. \n\n\nIf anyone is out there who has any experience dealing with VA psychiatrists with adult ADHD I would really appreciate their input. The VA is great, but it's kinda difficult to find the right words to say especially in these situations when talking to the psychiatrist. Thank You"

    "comment": "Yes!! I'm a 49yo woman and just got on Concerta in January. I'm kind of floored some days by how much I get done and how NORMAL that seems. I don't *feel* a difference as much as I DONT feel all the obstacles in my brain that I have to overcome before I can start to do anything. I was a biggest procrastinator and avoider, often relying on deadlines to be my motivation to do tasks i hated. But now, often, I think \"I should take those curtains down and wash them\" and the next thing I know I'm DOING it. It would seem completely normal except that I KNOW that it's not.\n\n\n  It would take me HOURS to get myself going in the morning unless I HAD to be there and til lunch for my brain to fully wake up. Now I'm still not a morning person but I can now actually accomplish something in the a.m.\n\nThe endless planning in my brain has quieted tremendously. It's still my habit but now when I catch myself at it I can redirect my thoughts! It's so much less exhausting that I can't believe people have lived like this their entire lives. It's crazy.\n\nOh and maybe the biggest difference is in the rage/disproportionate reactions OR lack thereof I should say! Someone flipped me off after stopping mid-lane in traffic one of the first days on it and I thought \"wow that was inconsiderate!\" And all but forgot about it. It was a NON issue. Before I'd have been very pissed, would've felt the need to scream back at them (instead of quietly returning the bird) and brooded over it. \n\nI just started working out again..and once again I cant get over the lack of negative chatter in my brain. Fighting that off mentally was honestly the worst part of exercising  and I didnt realize that it was from ADHD --until  I started running and biking again and wondering why it seemed so much easier this time. I really think it's the lack of crazy-brain. No wonder people can run and bike and all that and not loathe it! \n\nSo that's my experience. I'm 100% on board."

    "comment": "Since starting ADHD medication, I’ve seen major improvements across the board.\n\nCareer or school success\nWork has improved noticeably. Before meds, I constantly second-guessed myself. I’d doubt my understanding of legislation and worry about making mistakes. Since medicating, the quality of my work has gone up significantly. At first, my output dropped because I had more mental bandwidth but no clear direction. Once I re-established my routines, everything clicked. I’ve applied for a promotion, and for the first time I’m not overwhelmed by stress leading up to an interview.\n\nRelationships or marriage\nOne of the main reasons I sought medication was my wife. She carries a huge load as our main income earner and the one who kept everything running. I could see the weight she carried and worried she’d end up resenting me. Since starting meds, I’ve been able to step up more. She can finally take time off and actually relax. Our relationship was strong before, but it’s now the best it’s ever been.\n\nMotivation and achieving goals\nThe biggest shift has been clarity. I can start something, put it down, and come back to it. Medium and long-term goals no longer feel impossible. I’ve been able to create systems and follow through.\n\nFinancial stability\nImpulsivity has dropped massively. I’m not making random purchases or chasing food cravings. That’s made a big difference in terms of money management and general self-control.\n\nHealth\nI was on a high dose of blood pressure medication and still getting 150–165 over 75–95. Within three weeks of starting ADHD treatment, I began experiencing low blood pressure. After working with my GP, my meds were reduced, and now I’m close to coming off them completely. My readings are sitting between 115–125 over 60–70. It’s a huge shift.\n\nMental clarity\nI don’t feel “smarter,” but I feel like the noise has been removed. I can think clearly, focus, and follow a line of reasoning without getting derailed.\n\nLifestyle\nI’m well past the euphoric stage. The real benefits came after that, when I used the boost from the meds to make real lifestyle changes. I’ve improved my sleep, get regular sunlight and exercise, eat better, and stick to routines. The medication helped me build those habits, and in turn, those habits are making the medication work even better."

In my late seventies, I was still taking the one that worked, but as I aged, I lacked energy more and more. In my mid-seventies I faced some extremely depressing and exhausting problems I had to solve and had no one to help me. My depression was bad but manageable. The same antidepressant continued to make \"normal\" life livable, but less enjoyable.  The worst part was that I simply ran out of energy.  I mean OUT of energy.  My doctor prescribed a generic Adderall along with my antidepressant. I had absolutely no confidence whatsoever that it would work.  Finding the one antidepressant that worked was the result of so many trials and failures over so many years that I assumed Adderall would be a failure.  The first night, I swallowed one Adderall  without even thinking about it, not expecting anything. I took it mechanically, without expectations. The next morning, I sat up in bed and immediately noticed that I felt entirely different!  I instantly knew I was well.  It has been well over a year.  I can now cope with difficult situations and problems 99% better than ever before. Not one day has been extremely bad.  I will never forget the feeling I instantly had when I sat up in bed that first day."

    "comment": "When do you take the pill and when does fatigue set in? If it is at the end of the day, just accept it as part of your day... it can feel jarring because it is sudden and harsh, but it is just tiredness.\n\nIf it is stronger and you have rebound effects, maybe try taking a smaller dose towards the end of the day, like a 5mg immediate release or a 10mg long release dose.. that's what I do.\n\nMy current schedule is: 35mg in the morning with breakfast and 30mg with lunch. I take mine with food, to have a more even release profile.\n\nHere's how I figured out my dose step by step:\n\nFirst figure out the right first dose.. My doctor increased my dose by 10mg every week until we figured out if it was too much. At around 40mg I started feeling anxious, irritable and awful in the morning. It took me a while to realize what was going on because until then I was feeling fine for weeks! I thought i was just having some bad days at work and deadline stress got to me.\n\nWhen it dawned on me I dialed back and learned that 30mg was not enough. So I asked my doctor to prescribe some 5mg pills for the morning and that did the trick!\n\nWhenever I took my pill, I started the stopwatch on my phone and whenever I checked in with myself or when a timer went off (using Pomodoro or something), I checked in with myself and compared to the stopwatch and did a quick log in my chat program with my partner like \"3h17m Focus good, somewhat distractable by intrusive thoughts, but better than yesterday #meds\" Using the hashtag to make it searchable.\n\nAfter a couple of days I had some data and I also cross referenced it with release profiles I found online.\n\nI was able to compare my mood, emotional stability and focus to where in the release cycle the meds should be at. It is not exact because everybody has a different metabolism, but it helped me figure out my therapeutic range and also learn when it starts to taper off.\n\nWhen you notice it tapering off, you have to realize that it is a delayed effect to what you see on the graph. So it can be a bit tricky to figure out good timing for the second dose since it also has an on-ramp that overlaps with the first dose's offramp.\n\nIt still took some experimentation, but using this data-based approach made it feel like a project I am in control of, instead of just firing shots in the dark and being frustrated as to why it is not working and feeling at the mercy of this pill.\n\nEventually I landed on 35-30 and the right timings and meals to go along with it. Now when I take my first dose, I set a timer for when it is time for the second one and I just plan my day around that and do micro adjustments even to this day.\n\nAs soon as you have success with a pill, or even if you had success in the past, try to remember when you took it, how your sleep was, what you ate/drank with it, etc, if the sun was shining (for example, coffee is a stimulant and can seriously mess with the effect of the meds).\n\nWhat you eat with you pill, the pH value of it and how much fiber it has etc, also has a big impact on how the meds work.\n\nI also take vitamin D, omega 3, magnesium, zinc and all that good stuff.. basically, make sure you are not mistaking symptoms of some deficiency for the pill not doing, or, making sure you have all your bases covered so the pill can do its thing.\n\nWhen you're sick or in a bad mood or under the weather, I noticed that it either doesn't work or can make it worse. A lower dose on those days seems to help me stabilize my emotions and not make me antsy and irritable.\n\nHope that helps! It can be a lot of work, but if you take it one day at a time and do small adjustments based on what you observe about yourself, you will get there!"

Fog certainly isn’t a diagnostic-standard symptom, but it seems fairly established as something that some people experience in relation to their ADHD - people involved in my care certainly think so. But I’m not sure what I thought was brain fog really was that - I think I’d assumed that’s what it was and lacked better language to articulate it. More likely just an awareness of how dreadful my focus was on most things! In any case, going through diagnosis and then making sense of that and the effects of medication gives plenty of opportunities for learning and self-reflection. You’re right that a holistic mindset is very important, and to be aware of the temptation to jump to conclusions"

    "comment": "Idk if this comment bares resentment toward that “era” but I would like to make the case that pushing pills to ADHD youth is a good thing. \n\n1. A very large proportion of children with adhd who start medication (70-80%) have significant decreases in negative symptoms and have lasting positive outcomes, many even after stopping the medication. On top of that around 9% of children medicated early on are able to attain comparable cognitive performance (in ADHD relevant metrics) to non ADHD adults.\n\n2. Meds are a medical intervention (shocker) and they are often a more accessible alternative to therapy and they can also serve the dual benefit of enlightening the child’s parents to the fact that ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder and not some nebulous lack of character or a deep personal failing of laziness. That can be transformative in that child’s life and see them avoid years of trauma or just be able to live in a more supportive environment. An environment with more tools and information at their disposal. \n\nObviously parents can be supportive and children can be well informed without “pill pushing” and the combination of meds and therapy is almost always shown to be more effective and the benefits most long-lasting but meds (especially at an early age) should play a significant role in the individualized medical care of youth, at least until we understand the neural underpinnings of ADHD and related conditions."

It really does the heavy lifting. \nThat, and it allows me to not have to take my Adderall everyday. \nGranted, I am a bit more disorganized on days off of it.

There are various tests which are designed specifically to avoid the child having to know how to communicate how their cognition has changed. Not a perfect system but there are meant to be checks in place and there are positive results in general even if certain individuals respond badly to some medications. I responsible psychiatrist would also test different meds and doses to see what achieves minimum effective dose to address unwanted symptoms."

This is definitely not something that is a “you” problem. I’m sorry for the emotional pain your partner is putting you through because no one deserves that. \n\nWhen I was reading your post, I was like “damn this is almost an exact situation that I was in 5 years ago.” It’s an extremely toxic environment, and it’s so brave of you to post this knowing that you may be given advice to leave your partner. That pattern that they are displaying is that of a controlling and narcissistic (I know that term gets overused but its true here) person. \n\nIt’s an awful cycle of you trying your hardest to make them proud and love you, but they can’t find anything good about you (or more like they just don’t tell you.) For me it was everything you mentioned. Especially the “I feel like I have to parent you” thing. You tiptoe around them and cross your “T”s and dot your “i”s. Then literally the smallest thing  that ***no one in a healthy relationship would ever notice or care to even mention*** sets them off. \n\nThey make you feel like you’re the problem, you need work, you’re the messed up one.\n\nMy mental health was in the worst place it’s ever been in that relationship. Face swollen from crying everyday, but yet feeling like I can’t talk to anyone about it because clearly I am the one who needs to fix myself, and I’m “so lucky” to be with someone who tolerates my ADHDness.\n\nPlease believe me that that is NOT true. The first huge step that you took was posting here on Reddit and I am *so proud* that you did that. Hopefully this helps you see your situation from a different perspective. \n\nMy advice to you would be to break up with them. They will make you feel like you won’t be able to make it in the “real world” and no one will want you, but believe me that is the FARTHEST thing from the truth. \n\nI didn’t have the bravery that you do to reach out for help. He ended up breaking up with me after I talked to him about going to an out of state college even though I would’ve done long distance. He kicked me and my dog out of his apartment that night. My guess is that he wouldn’t have been able to control me from afar as much as he would’ve like. But even then, I didn’t see how toxic that relationship was and I was so wrecked emotionally and wanted him back for weeks. But when I realized it wasn’t going to work, I entered this shift in my mindset, and saw from a third perspective that it was actually a horribly unhealthy relationship. \n\nI worked on my mental health, and healing myself. I met my husband 3 months later and got married a year after that. I am so happy with my life now. There is such a quality and happiness that we share everyday.\n\nI’m sorry this is so long, but I really wanted you to know that the situation you’re in now does not have to be your situation forever. Your life can be beautiful, you just have to keep being brave and take those *really challenging* steps forward to prioritize yourself and your future.\n\nMuch love"

I started crying while I was reading your messages. Even in my worst, most horrible fights with people I love, I (and they) would NEVER speak like your bf did. It actually scared me to read. Horrific. Calling your gf a cunt and motherfucker and manipulative over and over and over again and then laughing when she's struggling...\n\nDo you want to experience this pain forever? I saw your texts begging him to stay... even after he treated you like that. I know it's hard if you feel lonely, but you'd rather be hated and in pain for the rest of your life? \n\nAlso, you cooked and cleaned and just forgot to put a blanket away so it smelled... I hope you know that's very very normal. My mom is a meticulous clean freak and even she does that. \n\nYou're doing normal adult things. You're supposed to be a team with your partner. He's not being a parent taking care of a child. He's abusive, destroying your self-esteem, making you feel worthless, and then using your triggered mental breakdown as an excuse to treat you like shit."

I doubt anything you do will ever be good enough for him.\n\nAll that stuff you did, all that productivity, that is you being capable. That is you putting your medication to use and being a functional person. Medication doesn't take the ADHD away, all the problems are still there, but the medication helps you to decide to do the things rather than be \"lazy\". It's not actual laziness, by the way, because it's not being done willingly. It's your brain making it hard for you to do things.\n\nHe got mad that you cleaned and cooked. Who gets mad at stuff being done around the house? He's complaining that he has to smell your cooking, he's complaining that you cleaned but missed a single thing. He's not a good or kind person. Maybe he has some mental problems that could use medication and therapy, but even then, that's no excuse to treat you that way.\n\nGood on you for making so much progress on medication. You're showering regularly, taking better care of yourself, even tidying the house and taking the time to cook food. That's a major win. Don't let him take that away from you."

Even after all of that, he is acting like an asshole about it. And mistakes or no, I feel like he is stringing you along and trying to get you to smash a home run so hard that he doesn't have to do anything anymore. An eye for an eye does NOT work in relationships.\n\nIf he is by any chance up for it, the way to deal with this would be for both pf you to air out EVERY small thing that has been building up. No matter how big, small or meaningless. The other person has to actively listen and validate the ither persons feelings.\n\nIf he is not, then moving on, in other relationships, try to talk about these things wvery once in a while. It isnt your partners responsibility to be your parent, but at the same time you do have ADHD, that you are still learning to manage. <- That is a reasoning, not an excuse, but you can really take some solace in that.\n\nI wish you the best of luck!"

The oven is still on!\"\nI apologized profusely, I felt so bad. Her response: \"Nothing happened, it's all good\"\n\nWhen she first moved in, I was terrified of not being good enough. Of being criticized for everything I didn't do. \nShe thanks me on a daily basis for whatever gets done. She sees that I vaccum cleaned, and acknowledges it. She also sees that I didn't do dishes but she does then herself. She picks up where I leave off and I try to do the same for her. \n\nFind yourself someone who sees what you do and who works with you to check all the boxes."

You are NOT wrong, and you have done nothing wrong. \nYou are enough, and you are doing so amazingly good and have improved OBVIOUSLY a LOT after diagnosis. \nAnd Jesus... Even someone without diagnosis could easily make these so-called mistakes your bf calls it, I mean, things he is obv looking for just to complain and push you down! \n\nI totally relate to you, I went for over 10 years undiagnosed because I just \"kept pushing it forward.\" \nFor a majority of those years my bf knew I had it but would complain at everything related to it (but did not support me in or help pushing me to go get diagnosed, just kept pushing me down) and I live in a country where its \"free\" healthcare and easy to get a diagnose. Most people here are also educated on adhd itself.\n\nI am a man, something I sometimes see in other guys is that they don't even seem to realize themselves this behaviour, but with a majority of them once brought up the they get defensive and even worse. \nA small portion actually listens and improve themselves, worth getting angry and tell about your feelings and hope he do take it in and improve himself for the future but I hope that it won't be with you because the damage he have done to you already is big especially because of your trauma from childhood.\n\nIt will not do you any good to stay.\nPlease leave him behind and go live YOUR life, and when you are ready, find a man who loves you FOR YOU and doesn't bring you down or ever makes you feel bad! \nMost importantly, who you can communicate with and improve and bring yourself up together.\n\nDon't ever let any man (or anyone) bring you down and especially don't let them abuse you or use your diagnose as a tool to do it.\nIt is not your fault he is this way, and you are not the one at fault here.\n\n1.5 year after my emotionally abusive bf I met a man who won't ever bring me down and always try to understand.. Even when he really doesn't understand at all sometimes.\nHe tries to improve life for us together and pushed me to just book that damn adhd investigation and go to every single of those sessions (I probably myself would of dropped out close to the end of it, if I even managed to get the call to book it done). So there is good men out there."

Being loved (worthy after all!) and not having to worry about the horrible rat race and being a useless failure. Of course since he's the provider she'll take up the bulk (or all) of the housework. And then she'll fail miserably at that, because it's soul-crushing monotonous hell. The guy will absolutely resent her and start to show it. And at that point she'll probably be financially trapped.\n\nPeople who want to take on a caretaker role in a relationship seem really nice, but it's about control and power. They seek out people who are vulnerable because they're easy to manipulate.\n\nADHD also comes with horrible working memory deficits, which makes us *extremely* susceptible to gaslighting. And we're impulsive so it's easy to be taken in by apologies and we overshare things that make it easy to hurt us."

    "comment": "Ok, there are a lot of people here calling your BF a terrible person after only hearing one story. I would say resist the urge to let these comments calling for you to write your BF off as abusive, hate filled, or spiteful. Living and loving a person with ADHD can be very difficult, particularly if the ADHD has gone untreated. There is a huge amount of resentment and hurt can build up over time as bad habits are settled into.  \n\n\nThis sounds like a deep and long-term issue, that couples therapy could be helpful for. If you do go the therapy route try and find someone who is familiar with ADHD relationships.\n\nI will say your BF has a point with the parent/child relationship dynamic, this is very common situation to end up in when one person has ADHD. This is something you will both need to work on if you are to get through this, you will need to become more dependable and reliable, and he will need to release control, be understanding and accepting when you make mistakes, and be supportive by acknowledging when you make progress and improve.  \n\n\nI am dealing with something similar myself in my relationship currently, where we have fallen into bad patterns and habits over years of being in a relationship with my untreated and undiagnosed ADHD.   \n\n\nI would recommend The ADHD Effect on Marriage by Melissa Orlov. It is a very good book to help you both understand the common pitfalls.  \n\n\nI haven't read it yet but check out \"Couple's Guide to Thriving with ADHD\" by Orlov if the first book was helpful."

Your boyfriend chooses to get upset at YOU for not living up to his standards. That’s a choice whether he knows it or not. You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink.

Like yeah, I understand his frustration from before you were medicated especially if he doesn't really understand ADHD.

I wouldn't be surprised if he's done similar things before and not even noticed or thought it was a big deal. \n\nSo, if this is an off day, then fine.

A few things I’ve learned: First, don’t do things to make him happy, do things to make yourself happy. Second, when he complains, ask yourself if this is something you genuinely need to work or improve on. If it’s not, that’s not a you problem, that’s a him problem and he needs to figure it out. And third, “It is what it is”. We do the best we can with the hand we were dealt. We’re all human. ADHD or not, none of us are perfect. You have to learn to give yourself a break but also don’t let this man put value on your worth. \n\nOn another note, his behavior is abusive. He’s not going to change, and it will probably get worse over the years. Kids in the mix make it way worse and it’s not good for you or them. He’s miserable because he’s miserable. It has nothing to do with you. You can’t make him happy, he needs to take responsibility for his own happiness. \n\nI wouldn’t wish what I went through on anyone, so you need to ask yourself this question, “do I want to live like this with him for the rest of my life?”."

    "comment": "I think there's a grieving process that many people go through when they've been diagnosed as an adult, especially if they struggled greatly when younger. This is definitely a recurring theme on this sub, particularly when you read posts by those of us much older.\n\nI was diagnosed in my 40's, and when I say I struggled academically despite being smart...I'm shocked I graduated high school (it was dicey for sure). I didn't have a full assessment until this past year at 52, and the only reason I did so was because I decided in all my impulsiveness that I missed learning and surely I would be a much better student now that I've raised two children. I had an absolute panic attack once I realized that I struggled and failed out of community college multiple times...like less than a 1.0 at times despite having raised two children with high IQs, having two sisters with high IQs and being surrounded by multiple family members who were clearly gifted and made me feel inadequate. \n\nI circled back for that full assessment, got set up with accommodations, and did really well for the most part, aside from raw dogging school without medication. The catalyst for starting medication was being in a course that was fully online and \"forgetting\" I was even enrolled and not doing two chapters worth of work and earning a well-deserved C as a final grade despite receiving 100% on every assignment, quiz, and test. That stung big time. It wasn't quality of work, it was remembering to do the work. I started medication in December, and this past semester I finished up a meaty course load with all A's. As thrilled as I am to realize I'm not a dumbass, that C absolutely stings a LOT. I'm a way different student than I was as a kid, I've learned so much about my brain and how it works, and how it prefers to receive information. There is a lot more confidence as an older student that honestly would have never been there as a kid even if I had a diagnosis. \n\nI'm preparing to transfer to university, and as part of that process I had to get my old transcripts. Those suckers are over 30 years old, and they were UGLY. I didn't quite realize just how awful they were, so facing those was difficult because they do impact my applying to university...I have to disclose them. I can't change my past (other than a little bit of academic renewal to have a couple of F's thrown out), but I can try to accept that it happened and accept that as an adult at this point in my life I have full control over how my story continues. The past doesn't have to be my last chapter. \n\nWhile it's important to process life before a diagnosis, and work through all of those feelings and \"what ifs\" if they are impacting you, looking ahead and seeing what you can control with the knowledge that you have now is also important. You get to finish your story on your own terms. I can't tell you how many women I know from my generation who did not get a diagnosis, and we've all come to them because we raised sons with ADHD or autism or even both and it resonated so heavily with us. \n\nYou've done awesome, getting back into school and being accepted to university is FANTASTIC, an as a mom...I'm super proud of you."

Hard time in school, with people. I have a 2 yo, whom I love to death. I thought that maybe a kid would help me with my will power and discipline. It did not. 6 months on meds and I have a will power, more control on my executive functions, somewhat no more depression, a will to live more experiences. But I have a kid. And I don't know how to balance my life. I was excited to be able to do stuff. And then I was freaking sad I lost all those years. My life is basically ruined right ? And now that I can somewhat start to live my life, I have a kid I have to take care of ??? Fucking no !!! But then... yes. And okay, the past was not great, but my future can be. My child is awesome, I can build a world for her, I can love her, learn from her and teach her. I have a wife that I love and loves me despite the trouble.  \n\nIt's not great. It's not the best.

It’s really fucking frustrating that psychiatry research is only just now getting taken more seriously and sometimes it makes me so mad. But I have to tell myself “sucks, but better late than never.” Comparison is the thief of joy, you gotta keep on keepin on. \n\nSome people go their whole lives miserable because they don’t believe in psychiatry or were raised thinking it’s a sign of weakness. THAT is the real nightmare. 25 is still very young, your brain just fully developed. It’s probably a good thing to be unmedicated while your brain is still growing because there hasn’t been enough research on what those drugs do to a developing brain. Being diagnosed as a kid so I could’ve gone to the therapy would’ve been tight, but I love my therapist now, I wouldn’t trade her for anything! \n\nI also tell myself I’d probably be so dull and one dimensional if I had perfect mental health.

It's a struggle - all those years lost or wasted or not as \"useful\" as they could have been, \"if only...\" - but what i have often found that is (partly) helpful is when I'm sliding into that dark spot, i scan my life for something that makes me happy or proud that day....\n\nOnce IDed, i roll back the video of my life... think about what things happened to put that \"happy\" or \"proud\" thing in my life...\n\nThen i consider, ok, if i had been diagnosed earlier, how would that have changed the trajectory of my life (you know, the butterfly effect)?\n\nWithin seconds i typically see a BIG connection to having NOT been diagnosed and the \"happy\" or \"proud\" thing for that day.  \n\nYup, it may not pull my completely out of going down that deep and dark \"if only\" hole, but it helps.\n\nGood luck!"

Keep up the good work.\n\nI sobered up for the first time when I was 26 and remember thinking \"God if ONLY I'd found this out earlier\" but the thing is, that is rarely a helpful vibe.  Instead I found it much more helpful and productive to focus on the future.  SO when I'd get down and bummed out at all the time I'd missed, I'd stop that train of thought and switch to \"At least I'm not 30 or 36\".  That would often trigger feelings of gratitude which was a much better energy for me.\n\nSo yeah while I wish I'd discovered it earlier I can't change that.  ALSO I tell myself \"It takes what it takes\" and maybe if I'd tried earlier in life, I wouldn't have been ready to know the truth.\n\nAnd I'm now having to do this with my ADHD - because at 58, I'm just now starting to realize I've likely been self-treating my symptoms of ADHD for my entire life and never knew it.\n\nI've spent years in therapy for alcoholism and no one suspected ADHD and so we didn't talk about it.  Primarily because I'm not always fidgeting and I can mask pretty damned well.  It was a survival mechanism that I remember developing early on in life.  If I could pretend to be whatever you wanted me to be, then life was a lot easier for me....especially with an alcoholic and often unpredictable dad.\n\nSo while I get that it's frustrating to think of lost time, but when you do, try to refocus and be grateful that you found it so early in your life and you don't have to spend years or perhaps even decades confused about why you are the way you are."

Most of us 50-year-olds are in deep depression of the decades we've lost, no savings or retirement, wondering how we'll make up for lost time. You're a baby. Check your emotional regulation and go have an herbal mocktail. Then start living like the multitasking queen you were born to be."

When I got to college (which was abroad) I couldn’t handle ADHD, homesickness, and the extra responsibilities I got all of a sudden. First semester, I would go all in and barely get a C average. Then next semester I can’t handle the symptoms anymore and would do nothing for days in terms of school but I would still play video games and tinker with electronics (so I know it is not depression). Eventually, I ended up losing my scholarship and returning home empty handed. I couldn’t handle the looks and attitude from family when they heard of my return. All this while under the age of 21. Packed with promises and family support for a second run, I end up going back to college but on my own dime, and this time, I took some courage and booked that appointment. I was about 23 of age. Everything has changed since that appointment. I have been getting straight A’s and even achieved the deans list. Unfortunately, I ran out of funds and had to get back home, but ever since I discovered the problem, I was able to finish college at home and get some extra certification that with the help of God, helped me get a high ranking corporate job like a missed nothing. \n\n\nYou absolutely have a bright future ahead of you and I wish you all the best"

But the peace I've found simply from receiving a diagnosis which allowed me to understand sooo much more about myself... and slowly learn how to communicate certain pieces with neur0typ!cal (can't use that word apparently) people in my life. \n\nI also learned that addiction and substance abuse issues are much more likely to affect undiagnosed/unmedicated individuals. I'm joyously 19 months sober now, BUT! I struggle to find the words that can adequately express the amount of \"what if\" I've battled with. \n\nADHD in women is not nearly as well understood or acknowledged as it is in men. It often presents much differently. (Sidenote: I can't stand when someone claims they're ADHD because they're loud or silly or quirky. ADHD isn't a fun, cute, silly little personality trait. I'll step down from my soap box now...) I'm thrilled to see more people speak up about it! And I'm glad the medical community appears to be slowly but surely coming around to it... \n\nANYWAY! I'm so glad you advocated for yourself, found a doctor to LISTEN and HELP, and have now found a new peace unlike anything you've experienced before. I hope you continue to find that peace in new ways and grow through it all. 🫶🏻"

    "comment": "A good pharmacist for a change. He is absolutely right. there are several reasons, but he is likely referring to the instant release of large doses of concerta at once. Concerta is released slowly, making it less addictive and harder to abuse. booze can release too much concerta at once. it can boost side effects, shorten the duration and build resistance. it can also give you a short \"high\" you would not feel with the extended release. the. combo isn't popular recreationally because it's hit or miss and it's easier to abuse short release drugs.\n\n  \nThe only thing more dangerous than alcohol is probably sertraline or something else that could cause serotonin syndrome.\n\n  \nPeople mix redbull (CNS stimulant) with whiskey (CNS depressant) all the time, but ADHD medication isn't something you take to mix with something that takes away the effects of the drug, it is a warning sign of drug abuse."

So it’s been discussed with your doctor it sounds like, but the pharmacist was likely doing his due diligence and trying to make sure you take the medication safely. Doesn’t sound like they tried to withhold it.\n\nI heard a story through WSJ that during the pandemic when people were getting stimulants prescribed through scammy telehealth companies, the companies were prescribing stimulants so recklessly that they were being prescribed to patients with history of addiction who then became addicts again. And they were never warned of the risks by either the provider or pharmacist that it was contraindicated, and many of them said they never would’ve taken them if they’d been informed. \n\nWhile sometimes pharmacists seem to overstep, this really is entirely within their job duties and responsibilities to ask questions like this."

I'm on Vyvanse as well as Wellbutrin. Maybe the Wellbutrin balances it out? Like if the Vyvanse got me 'high' it would affect me more but I don't find I'm needing to drink more to feel the effects. And if this is a concern maybe they should give those people Wellbutrin instead of both?

Per Wikipedia. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphenidate#interactions\n\nWhen methylphenidate is coingested with ethanol, a metabolite called ethylphenidate is formed via hepatic transesterification,[104][105] not unlike the hepatic formation of cocaethylene from cocaine and ethanol. The reduced potency of ethylphenidate and its minor formation means it does not contribute to the pharmacological profile at therapeutic doses and even in overdose cases ethylphenidate concentrations remain negligible.[106][105]\n\nCoingestion of alcohol (ethanol) also increases the blood plasma levels of d-methylphenidate by up to 40%.[107]\n\nLiver toxicity from methylphenidate is extremely rare, but limited evidence suggests that intake of β-adrenergic agonists with methylphenidate may increase the risk of liver toxicity.[108]"

You can't listen to one person say \"I think it makes you drink less\" and take it as gospel. \n\nIt is known that alcohol and stimulants should not be mixed for health reasons. The other thing stimulants do is diminish the effects of alcohol. So you'll have to drink more to get any desired effects, which can lead to alcohol abuse.\n\nListen to the pharmacist.

I haven't been on any ADHD meds since then, even though i wish i can take them since they helped when i took them prescribed. I just know i would talk myself into taking more for a better feeling and focus. I also took Wellbutrin which also helped me quit smoking. \n\nMind you ever since i stopped taking them, i brought my gpa from a 1.6 to a 3.6, graduating with a bachelor's degree.

We also noted a low overall risk (≤5%) of clinically significant cardiovascular events, including tachycardia or hypertension.\n\nFrom [Westover and Halm (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2261-12-41):\n\n>Findings of an association between prescription stimulant use and adverse cardiovascular outcomes are mixed. Studies of children and adolescents suggest that statistical power is limited in available study populations, and the absolute risk of an event is low. More suggestive of a safety signal, studies of adults found an increased risk for transient ischemic attack and sudden death/ventricular arrhythmia. Interpretation was limited due to differences in population, cardiovascular outcome selection/ascertainment, and methodology.\n\nOf course, this is just two papers out of many, but these papers suggest the risk is quite low."

Only over a certain threshhold. \n\nSo you dont need to worry about this if youre at risk which is why when on medication you check blood pressure frequently.\n\nYou may be 20 points under having high blood pressure, and meds increase BP by 1 point causing no problem. If you're 1 point off high BP and  meds increase BP by 1 point then it may be a problem. \n(Ik terminology is wrong and BP isnt one unit im soeaking hypothetically) \n\nBut if you're BP is thay high, then you need to worry about a lot more than just meds. You need to worry about your entire lifestyle\n\nI would be more worried about HRV and ECG than BP when it comes to medications but even they can be misleading and i wouldnt worry about minor hicups only major ones\n\nThis is not medical advice i am not a doctor"

Most of the time children experience more severe side effects(which is why the dosage is usually smaller) and this is important because most of the data we have is on children. That said, raised blood pressure and heart rate aren't that common. One study took 736 teenagers taking methylphenidate(ritalin) and compared the results to a placebo group of 368.  12.2% of the methylphenidate group had elevated BP and 9.6% in the placebo group. Also the elevations in BP are usually small. If you're worried there are some things you can do like take magnesium, eat more fruits and veggies, replace your salt with a potassium based substitute(there are mixtures of potassium and sodium salt but there isn't a pure potassium salt), stop drinking coffee."

ADHD medication is nothing different from any other medical treatment, and many medications started out \"natural\" but we learned to make the exact same thing ourselves so we didn't have to strip down entire rainforests for it.

As such, **taking ADHD medication reduces the societal, financial, and emotional burden of ADHD.** You live a happier life with less crises, less late fees, etc. Think about how we prescribe drugs for high cholesterol and high blood pressure - long term, it reduces the chance for more catastrophic heart issues (e.g. stroke) and is really helpful in reducing total emotional, physical and cost burdens. \n\n**Stimulants have been proven safe in long-term studies. Higher blood pressure or heart rate is noted as one very common side effect, but long-term EKG changes or heart issues are not an issue**. Admittedly, there are a lack of good studies in this area because prescribers are comfortable prescribing stimulants long-term. Most of the studies follow up at around the 2 year mark, and are not super large (n = 100-200 ish). Again, this is because these drugs are highly effective have been available for a long time so pharma companies are less incentivized to do large, expensive long term studies. As ADHD gets diagnosed more, I expect to see more long-term cohort control studies in the future. \n\nThis is all to say that **we should be taking medication if we need it**. If you need them and they will lead to a better life for you, then whats the harm? It leads to better outcomes for you at work, in relationships, in day-to-day functioning, financially, and so much more. If my chemicals are out of balance, then why shouldn't I fix it with other chemicals? \n\n**My family members don't like taking medications for their blood pressure and cholesterol,** because **'I'd rather manage it naturally, it's too many chemicals'.** They change their tune very quickly when I show them large studies showing decreased stroke, heart attacks, and deaths in people who take medications long-term. \n\nHere are studies on the cost-effectiveness of stimulants (comparing healthcare costs in medicated vs non-medicated). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1180839/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1180839/)\n\nHere is a study on the total economic burden of ADHD in a society. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34806909/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34806909/) \n\nHere is a study on long-term safety and efficacy done in adults. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33017854/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33017854/)\n\nA couple more safety studies in children and/or adolescent populations. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36958362/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36958362/) \n\nAnd here is a **meta analysis** on safety and efficacy ADHD meds. These are the best of the best studies - they take data from as many studies as they can find, combine it, then analyze it as a whole.

I'm so hypersensitive to any sign of anxiety in my body, that I'd instantly trigger my panic even more.\n\nThe neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine, that are either increased or the reuptake inhibited by medication, play a role in the relationship of the frontal lobe and the amygdala, which is responsible for the fight and flight response. The stimulants should balance that relationship, so stress should actually decrease."

When i search through literature though it seems there is an association with ADHD and Alzheimer's in some form, like this one: [https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/alz.12462](https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/alz.12462)\n\nThat doesn't say anything about if stimulant treatment will change the Alzheimers risk though. But they suggest in the discussion that since ADHD correlates with substance abuse, physical injury and low educational achievement, the added risk could come from ADHD related behaviors.\n\nThe sort of overarching conclusion i've come to when i started searching around is that low dose methylphenidate (concerta, ritalin, medikinet etc.) is absolutely safe long term, and even the higher doses seem to be so as well. Personally, my blood pressure is unaffected by the dose i'm on (which is on the lower end). In fact, long term it will probably lower it due to the secondary effect of being able to exercise more and eat less."

    "comment": "I would imagine the true reality is impossible to determine, hence why a causal factor cannot, and probably will not, ever be determined.\n\nYour hunch would also be impossible to prove because there is no way to compare the results of both situations. If someone is medicated, you will never know how long they could have lived without it, and if unmedicated, you cannot know how long they would have lived if medicated.\n\nSo, say one with ADHD gets in some kind of accident due to being distracted. Well, did ADHD cause the accident? That’s pretty damn hard to discern. Every human is capable of being distracted, and distractions lead to all kinds of accidents. \n\nI would need to review the research again, but there are so many variables that can factor into an accident. Take driving for example, inclement weather, sleep deprivation, animals, substance use, mechanical issues, etc.. I highly doubt the research investigated the circumstances surrounding every single accident in their reviews involving a person with ADHD in an accident.\n\nRationally, it makes sense that ADHD => More Distractions and More Distractions => More accidents, but that does not mean ADHD = More accidents. \n\nOf course, this type of data is usually compared against other populations, but proving causality is still not possible.\n\nFor example, hot chocolate is drank more frequently in cold weather. There are more accidents in cold weather. But it would be weird (and incorrect) to say hot chocolate causes more accidents. It would correct to say there might be a positive correlation between hot chocolate and accidents in the winter."

My key advice, from my experience, is try not to get attached to labels, be open to where your symptoms/reactions take you, and don't get hung up on whatever is working for you is 'supposed' to treat - a lot of us have a well mixed psychological cocktail to work with, and it's no use trying to guess which order the ingredients came in, as long as you know what they are!\nI also have MDD - I am convinced if I was treated for ADHD first, I would have had a much easier path discussing and managing my depression - but it wasn't until I got my depression medicated correctly that I was able to clearly identify and seek my ADHD diagnosis. I spent over a decade being passed around and trying combos of meds, met my new Psychiatrist once and he agreed to prescribe me an atypical antidepressant - felt like a new person within days - completely turned my life around within a year."

A friend of mine cued me in after addressing similar symptoms that mimicked my own and thankfully, my psych doctor believed me enough to try something out.\n \nEven if you eventually find it doesn’t help the ADHD symptoms the way you like, if it treats the anxiety you mentioned, it can be life changing."

The first two months I added Wellbutrin were amazing, pretty much like you describe. It didn't feel like I was high or euphoric, but all of those little things that were usually a struggle became straightforward. If I saw something on the floor, I would just pick it up. I'd get out of bed on time. I wouldn't get sucked into doomscrolling on my phone, etc. \n\nAbout two months in or so, the effects definitely diminished. The Wellbutrin still helps me a lot, but it's not like it was those first two months and it was definitely disappointing when it happened. \n\n I mention this not to rain on your parade (and it might not even apply to you), but just to help you set your expectations."

    "comment": "If you feel dramatically different in just a few days please speak with your doctor. It’s not common to feel a huge difference, and most meds take around 2-6 weeks for improvement of motivation, enjoyment of life, hopelessness or feeling sad, and most improvements people tend to notice are usually side effects masked as improving such as restlessness, bursts of energy, and feeling more alert and can sometimes subside or shift into insomnia or agitation. It could also be a sign of mania, sounds very much like those symptoms. If you talk to your doc and they give you the thumbs up, I wouldn’t worry about that though. It is also possible that it IS working, some people are just more sensitive than others, which is why it’s important to relay this info to your doctor who can keep track of mood shifts and the timing based on when you started meds. I wish you all the luck my friend, and as someone with adhd who has a hard time starting tasks, I’m proud of you!"

    "comment": "Unfortunately Wellbutrin gave me headaches and tremors like mad, and other stimulant alternatives haven't really worked 100% for me. Adderall has always been great on my motivation and social anxiety, as well as my inability to regulate my impulse control it is a life saver. I regularly make better choices when on it, I can think through things in a much quicker manner to allow myself to make the right decisions. \n\n\nBefore I started taking Adderall I would have dozens of scattered thoughts and be left with social and life choice indecisiveness that plagued my ability to do anything, so either I didn't or I did what was easiest or what would give me that rush. \n\n\nSomething fun always seemed to be the way to go because normal every day tasks seemed not only just not be the right choice in my mind but drudging and depressing if I did, I would get angry about having to actually do my dishes (which I mean nobody likes dishes but it's gotta be done) and these things would put me in a depression as most tasks people dont like to do have to be done over and over and seem to have no point. \n\n\nSo I never got anything done, and quickly my life spiraled out of control in many ways. I lost my jobs many times, I lost friendships, I went to jail, I moved across the country twice instead of facing the music. \n\n\nCurrently I'm at a point where I am at odds with this prescription, I take 15 mgs and it doesn't seem to do anything for me anymore, and I've moved up from 5mgs to 15 over 7 months, I had recently stop taking it when their was a shortage, life went to hell to say the least, and I'm afraid I am either just going to be stuck going up every time it doesn't work, until I hit the top and then it doesn't work there either, or my doctor is just going to stop upping my doses until I find the right fit, or just no longer prescribe them to me, because he asked me if I was abusing it, I told him no(I am not), and that his question concerned me because I'm not, and told him why. \n\n\nIt lead to a disagreement, then he stated he was going to give me a referral to another doctor, like to transfer me to someone elses care, but it's like, I take this medication to help regulate my impulse control, and it's not doing what it's supposed to, and now when I ask for the dosage to be upped and we get into a disagreement because its not working the way it should, you give me a give me a hard time? I just don't get it. It's not like I'm some punk kid either, I had been taking this medication for years and stopped taking it when the adderall shortage happened, and was at a higher dose, but now it's a problem to get me back to that? Huh... \n\n\nSo adderall and stimulants aren't exactly all they are cracked up to be, they are wonderful when they work yes, but it's a slippery slope that I feel needs to be figured out. If there was a way to reverse someone's tolerance to drugs like this it would make them safer and more effective, this would help people for the duration of their lives rather than being looked down upon and shamed when they want something they know will work."

The biggest one was definitely the insomnia it caused, but it was strange, I'd wake up feeling fully refreshed even if I only slept for 4 hours.\n\n  \nI wish that feeling never went away. Also to me, it might sound silly, but I felt like I became dumber. I felt that way because I was in my head a lot less than I usually was (BY A LOT), and what was crazy is that certain things didn't bother me as much, like how I felt about my weight and body. I was 5'9\" 165lbs feeling like I was obese, but after being on Wellbutrin for a bit, I no longer felt that way. I also for the most part didn't care how others would perceive my body. It was a strange feeling.\n\n  \nNow... Wellbutrin did not solve all of my problems. I had issues working remotely, and Wellbutrin helped to some extent, but it wasn't great. Vyvanse has been fantastic for that."

When/if you decide to come off, you'll probably need to taper off. \n\n(Stimulants at therapeutic doses have essentially no withdrawal/discontinuation effects. People with stimulant prescriptions routinely forget to take them, and recently we've been running out of them for days or weeks at a time with no ill effects other than the return of symptoms.

    "comment": "Yeah Ive been where you are in the past many times. with the current ADHD medication im on which is to be taken twice a day for it to last throughout the entire day. I have a weekly schedule for the days I take my ADHD meds and its based on my school work and job. So every week i’ll take my meds Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and sometimes Sunday if I push off my weekly assignments to the last day. I dont take my meds on Monday’s, Tuesday’s, Saturday’s, and sometimes Sunday’s. I know taking days off can be rough but I firmly believe the pro’s out weigh the cons in the long run with taking stimulant meds. I notice with this schedule my meds feel more effective on a weekly basis because of the days I take off every week, it helps prevent tolerance buildup, so I havnt felt like I needed a higher dosage and another plus I have extra after every month which is helpful with the current shortage. Another thing I notice is on my days off I still feel capable of getting through my day.  Without feeling like im dragging a 500 pound weight everywhere, unmotivated, fatigued, depressed, similar to what OP described. Dependency is normal with every medication that is taken daily. its not a bad thing by any means when taken as prescribed. But after trying many different Adhd meds over the past 5 years while taking them 6 or 7 days every single week it did more harm to my overall mental health in the long run. I also consistently felt like my dosage was not high enough. That cycle repeated for a while until I set up that schedule for myself. \n\nSorry about the length of my post, I just think its really important to educate people that even though ADHD meds are lifesaver’s for us they can sometimes cause a negative impact for one’s mental health if taken daily.\n\nEdit: I realize This is topic varies in opinion from person to person. This is just my experience and how ive found the best results with my meds since being diagnosed  back in 2018"

Previously I was on 1 dose (20mg daily) and found that even on the days I took it super late (like 1 pm because I had to be focused for work during the evening), I had no problems sleeping. And now I 50/50 take my booster as late as 730pm and fall asleep no problems at 11pm.

I'm basically useless that day. Sometimes I just don't have the time in my schedule to spend an entire day doing nothing, but I try to make room for it. I just think of it as a rest day. I sit around with my husband, watch movies all day and nap. Maybe go for a walk, but mostly i dont expect much from myself that day. It's not ideal, but this is the hand I was dealt. If I was diabetic I wouldn't be able to eat that slice of cake. If I had kidney disease I would have to spend time on dialysis. As far as health issues go.. having to do a lazy TV day a few times a month as part of the management of my ADHD is not too bad.\n\nI also think the bounce back after regularly being on meds is tougher BECAUSE you're body is adjusted to them. I DEFINITELY struggle without my meds, but I'm not sure it's fair to compare myself one day off of meds to my medicated self. \n\nA fairer comparison would be me 2-3 weeks off of meds vs. medicated. 2 weeks off of meds I'm scatter brained, unfocused, procrastinating, fidgety, it takes me forever do things because i get distracted, etc. But I'm not sluggish the way I am the first day off. Part of my unmedicated symptoms are that my thoughts jump around... a lot. I can't shut my brain off. My thoughts are always going a mile a minute to the point where I can't sleep because I can't stop thinking. It's exhausting. First day off of meds I don't have that problem. If anything, my brain is slower. 2-3 weeks of the meds and that shit is back in full force."

I notice if I skip completely for 1-2days , it takes me at least the 2nd or 3rd day of resuming to mentally get back to the “drivers seat”. \n3) tolerance breaks are good, mostly bc we can’t rely on the supply the same way as say with blood pressure meds, but also spiritually it’s an opportunity to take a humble break \n4) to gamify tolerance breaks by willing myself to do the “easiest” things, like waking up and go straight out around the block for a walk bc if I hesitate for a second I won’t know what to change into/ if I should eat breakfast/which morning/hygiene routine to do first.

If I don’t, it’s awful. I’m thinking I may need to increase to 30mg currently on 20mg. Initially when I first increased to 30mg it was hell, but I’ve learned, I need to eat or drink something with protein around lunch time to stave off any side effects. I would get horrible anxiety when it start to wear off, but unlike before when I first tried I wasn’t on Ozempic. I now am and my meds last longer now that I’m on Ozempic (I’m a fast metabolizer of stimulants) and Oz seems to slow down how fast I metabolize medications which is great on my end. I know there’s a few other ADHD people on GLP meds who say the same thing which is great but not so great for people who don’t need GLP meds because that shit works."

The motivation took a little longer to leave, maybe a few weeks or a month, but I’m confident now the vyvanse isn’t helping me at all. I wish there were meds for autism sometimes LOL"

But take a day off when you actually have nothing to do. Relax if you can. Communicate with your partner and let them or other family know you're taking a day off.

    "comment": "I took Vyvanse for 15 years. The way you feel when you don’t take it is an extremely exaggerated version of what normality feels like.\n\nI’ve been off Vyvanse / stimulants for 4 years now and I can now work completely fine. Getting off though was a huge struggle. HUGE. I was really addicted.\n\nYou described needing a higher dose already. That is what happens. You slowly need more. By the end I was on 60mg twice per day (!!) and I thought it was completely normal. I freaking loved it at the time. But it came with a huge cost. I was hyper productive, unable to chill, obsessed with getting things done.\n\nEventually I went into psychosis after trying to ween off, but then going back to my original dose because I was craving it so bad. After battling mania/psychosis for a few months, I finally kicked the habit and now I’m clean and I love it.\n\nLife without vyvanse has been revolutionary for me. No, I’m not hyper productive, but I can still get locked in and get things done.\n\nTL:DR; I’m typing this because I don’t want to see others become addicted to Vyvanse like I was. It feels amazing but it comes with a large cost down the road. It is making your ADHD baseline worse when you are not on the Vyvanse, as you found with your day off.\n\nI’m happy to have a conversation with you about this."

The issue with a one or even a few day break is that I am below below baseline, so I’m feeling worse than I would if I was off it for a long period of time, say a week or two. But I can’t afford more than a day here and there and that only works if I truly have nothing important to do. And I have wife, kids, job, house, so that pretty much never happens. The few times it has worked out I was kinda useless but I did feel more rested the next day."

Point is there’s absolutely no judgement here but wanted you tk be aware of the other side of the coin.

In my experience skipping vyvanse sucks, i dont feel like doing much, kind of feels like a mild hangover that lasts a couple days. Now when I went off adderall, well that was a different story for me. Crippling anxiety and fear of un reasonable things happening. Lingering feeling of doom and dread on top of feeling generally miserable. All new things to me. I do not have anxiety and am generally not a fearful person. This is leaving out the actual side effects of getting insatiable hunger and unlike me anger in the evenings when on it. I went through that and then asked to switch to vyvanse and give it a try. Way better, generally well tolerated besides it spikes my blood pressure early in the day."

    "comment": "Yes, it is a stimulant. For what it's worth, when I first took Adderall and Vyvanse I had similar side effects and then after like two weeks the side effects either became like a lottt weaker or completely disappeared. I rarely get headaches, never got blurred visions though, and it hardly affects my appetite anymore. I used to get really tired when it wore off but that doesn't happen anymore at all. I found that taking it on the weekends when I didn't work was still helpful like spending less money when I shopped, less mistakes when driving, and a better listener when my partner talked to me. The only reason I don't take it on the weekends now is bc after a little under two years I learned I quickly develop a tolerance and the highest dose did nothing. My work performance suffered a lot and then my mental health crumbled bc of it and I had to take a very long medical leave/drug vacation. That's not the case for everyone. Some ppl take it years and years and barely develop a tolerance if at all. If that were the case for me I'd definitely take it on the weekend bc ADHD affects every part of your life, not just school or work. I remember crying when I realized how much easier reading for fun was when I took ADHD. When I tried to do it without meds for the first time I felt so dumb and that's when I cried. Anyway, maybe that helps?"

Just fill a measuring cup with the same amount of milliliters as the amount of milligrams of the capsule, then open the capsule and pour all the powder in. Then mix it and take out whatever milliliters you want the dose to be. E.g. if you have 70mg capsules and want a 50mg dose, mix the powder with 70mls of water and then take out 50mls and drink that. This advice was given to a lot of people here during the shortage of Vyvanse because the 70mg was still available, so they'd be prescribed the 70mg and then take whatever dosage they needed using the water dilution method."

I've I was told the name brand Vyvanse is now some kind of gell beads and can't/isn't easy to divide??\n\nAnyways, always best to consult with your prescribing professional about any dosing changes, etc. But being a controlled substance sometimes it seems they just have to reiterate the guidelines they are told they have to. In the US they will not prescribe be two on the same pill each day, was told that was against DEA rules.

Lisdexamfetamine (the generic drug in name brand Vyvanse is a somewhat slow release inherently because it's a \"prodrug\" and your body has to break off the lysine molecule attached to the lisdexamfetamine molecule to release the amphetamine molecule and that takes place over time. I believe the gel beads in name brand Vyvanse as described to me, never seen it with my own eyes are for additional slow release. Which I worry would be too slow? I need to take any lisdexamfetamine I take in a day first thing in the morning or getting to sleep can be quite problematic.

If you want 2/3 drink 2/3 the glass of water.\n\nWorks like a charm for me, so if I forget to take it and it's 1pm I can take a half dose and not be up until 5am."

If you have any problems or concerns you discuss those issues with your psychiatrist and/or GP.\n\nPersonally I'm likely to take this med for life since my ADHD is severe enough to the point where I'm a literal potato without it. For me the benefits significantly outweigh the risks. Long as I'm financially able to afford treatment and there are no health issues I'm going to continue taking it.\n\nNot trying to convince you here. Just offering a different perspective."

But when I start to take the meds again after the break it's usually fantastic again. Can you make any sense of that or do you have an idea what I could do/take to not have to take those breaks? It's not an issue of dosing too high as far as I can tell, I was only taking 15mg of Vyvanse for the most part.

Of those the stimulants where far and away the most helpful. Moclobemide and Wellbutrin helped a little bit but with more side effects, the rest either did nothing or had mostly just side effects. \n\nI would be interested in trying Intuniv, but when I asked my doctor about Guanfacine she said it can't be prescribed. Seems like it's not approved for adults in my country. Maybe I could get it offlabel if I press her on it, but then my insurance might not pay for it because it's not approved for adults... and it's too expensive for me to pay out of pocket."

For example I struggle a lot with starting work tasks, but anecdotally a sip of alcohol does seem to help significantly with that. Arguably more so than the stimulants. Those mainly help against the depression. So I do suspect I would benefit from adding another medication that targets different receptors and I'm trying to narrow down which ones those might be and what my options are. \n\nI forgot to mention, I'm taking Propanolol against stimulant side effects and I find it helps notably with anxiety and phobias as well."
  },
  {
    "medication": "Concerta",
    "comment": "I find alcohol is a very slippery slope for me. It can help but also leads me to consume greater and greater quantities quickly because I have a naturally high tolerance for it and the effects wear off quickly. The tipping point comes when I’ve consumed so much that it no longer helps me. For a time I was drinking daily while (on stimulants, but in the evening when they wore off) to help me study in grad school but it became unhealthy and now I drink only very occasionally socially (or not at all, given that I’ve been pregnant/postpartum the past 20 months). I know there is an extraordinarily high propensity for alcohol use disorder among folks with ADHD especially when untreated so it’s something I’m also mindful of.\n\nI’ve found high caffeine intake is a necessity off meds. On meds I still consume it but probably shouldn’t as it certainly increases side effects of stimulants.\n\nThat’s interesting about propranolol. I was on bisoprolol when I was in third trimester pregnancy because I had a POTS flare up (where your heart rate and blood pressure go wonky when standing or ping activities). I was on stimulants at the time but honestly can’t remember if it helped with the stimulants side effect besides maybe reducing heart rate (which is why I was taking it). It just made me feel very very tired. I know Guanaficine is used as a blood pressure med too but I think the mechanism of action is different.\n\nI’ve not found any other meds/substances to be of much use. The only other mood targeting drug I’ve been on is antidepressants and I haven’t needed these since I began stimulants 18 year ago - turns out my depression was just untreated ADHD, so treating that worked much better for my mood than trying to target my mood directly. I still found I got some anxiety and mood swings that were worsened on stimulants, and Intuniv helped stabilize my mood and decrease my ‘stimulant anxiety’. At one point I also did a brief trial of non stimulants for adhd but they didn’t work for me.\n\nEdit to add: for me, the best mood boosting stimulant (ie to reduce feelings of sadness and low mood/depressed feelings) by far is dexederine. It’s otherwise not the ideal med for me as I get lots of side effects and yet I keep returning to it because I get that extra mood boost."

    "comment": "Thanks a lot for the detailed reply, much appreciated! I had a hunch alcohol might be working for you too, but it's a slippery slope for sure. I treat it as a last resort. From what I read the mechanisms at play there might lead to paying for it later the same way one does with taking benzos. \n\nI believe dexedrine is quite similar to vyvanse, but quicker acting and doesn't last as long.\n\nI found the propanolol helps quite well against \"stimulant anxiety\" for me, not just for lowering the heartrate back down. I can't really compare it to bisoprolol because I only took that once. Neither of them made me tired. \n\nCaffeine is a tricky one, I haven't quite figured out yet what the right dose is for me. At the moment I drink one instant coffee in the morning, which should be around 40 to 50mg of caffeine, and any more than that seems to be detrimental. E.g. pepsi already is too much. Before I was on the proper stimulants I was leaning quite heavily on caffeine, but I can't tell for sure whether that was just addiction or whether it actually helped."

    "comment": "For me, although they are relatively similar, dexedrine and vyvannse feel different enough in notable ways. I had to be on 70mg of vyvannse (max dose) and only 20mg on dexedrine (half the max dose) because I found vyvannse just didn’t give me the same buzzy ‘get up and get going’ initial stimulation that Dexedrine does. It lasts longer but takes longer to set in. I switch to it when I find things aren’t working as well for me with the dexedrine (meds switch up to reduce the tolerance) but always end up back on dex! \n\nAnd great to know about the propranolol. I may consider going back on a beta blocker if my heart rate starts spiking again. I just wish I didn’t get the fatigue, you are lucky that you don’t."

Thought I just had a bad memory, turns out time blindness was the reason! Working hard to change how I structure my day now to allow me freedom to be in my natural flow states.\n2) My infertility - turns out the high level of anxiety and cortisol, together with lower levels of DHEA (a correlation found in a few recent studies of even kids with ADHD), have significantly lowered my egg quality, and until recently were contributing to PCOS and Endo.

It was like all those voices (thoughts) were a whisper, and I had a sound desk in front of me where I could dial up the volume of what I wanted to hear better, which thoughts I would give attention to. \n\nAnd much the same happened with actual voices and sounds outside of my mind. Not only I became more able to select and ignore, the impact these things had in my cognition was greatly reduced. \n\nI first noticed this when I started the meds and had started a new job at a new factory, roughly around the same time.

I recognized as an adult that I totally shut down for a few seconds if I’m faced with an unexpected, chaotic, or overwhelming sound. For example I was talking with my boyfriend one night while we drove home from his parents and he was playing the Beatles. One of their songs has an experimental instrumental part that sounds like an orchestra falling down a staircase. I shut down and couldn’t process the words my boyfriend had said to me. Seconds later I heard him saying “hellooo??” and I apologized and asked him to repeat himself. He got upset and accused me of not caring about what he had to say. When I tried explaining what happened it took a lot to get him to understand. Not enough doctors are talking about auditory dysfunction in people with ADHD.

My dr said he’d give me two different types of medication to try, because usually only one type works. So first I was on Dexedrine for 2 weeks, and it worked fantastic — life changing, like so many stories. Then the next 2 weeks I was on Ritalin, and it was a flop, no effect… EXCEPT one night I was out to dinner at a loud restaurant and suddenly realized I could hear my dinner conversation perfectly. Blew my mind, after years of getting my hearing checked and being told it was fine. \n\nI’ve been on the Dexedrine ever since, since that’s the one that works for my ADHD, but I still miss that magical superpower I briefly experienced."

One positive is that I am able to hyper focus, which helps me be successful in my job. However, Lexapro has done wonders for the huge anxiety I've always carried around. Happy to hear this has worked for you."

Even if it’s a day but if you can wait more - the longer the better, so then your tolerance goes back down. \n\nBut I find that 2-3 days but a week is even better tbh. I’m gonna see how 5mg goes if I can do longer breaks and see if I need to increase"

But keep in mind that it's also an overactive focusing mechanism dance that goes on with your brain trying to compensate to make a clear picture, forcing the focusing mechanism of your eye to \"wiggle\" more or less over the point that would be in focus, instead of locking in to focus on the thing. \n\nI dunno all the science behind it, but I do know that while that much Adderall was in my system, I couldn't wear my glasses because they made everything out of focus, and everything was in focus without them on. The next day after I'd slept it off, I was back to having to wear my glasses to see clearly. \n\nI'm near sighted in one eye and far sighted in the other with astigmatism in both, but my vision is only off so much that the difference is like watching 90's \"standard definition\" tv with my glasses off vs 2020s tech HD with my glasses on for anything farther away than about 6 feet.

But the process for me was that the same doctor that gave me the ADHD diagnose and did the evaluation did write me write out 18mg , I was given 18 mg for the 2 first weeks, and I was told that if I do not notice anything after 2 weeks I should go to 36, so I went to 36. I was on 36 for about 4-5 weeks (because of holiday), then I went back to the same place who had done the evaluation for adhd and autism, and got it raised to 54, then I was on that for several weeks and I didn't really feel anything. I could not pinpoint a change, the nurse I talked with was thinking about me trying something else, but I thought about trying 72 and the doctor thought that 72 was a good idea to test as well, so if you have been on 18mg for several weeks (more than 2) I would suggest talk with a doctor, mention that you do not feel any effect and ask them to raise the dosage.  \nI do not really feel much on 72. I know there is a difference because I have know that it becomes a bit more chaotic if I do not take it.  \nMany talk about feeling that their brain gets quiet on the meds, like the thoughts are not longer running around. I don't feel that, but I'm not sure that I really had chaotic brain/thoughts either.  \nUnfortunately the medication does not work for everyone. and not every medication works the same. You will have to find what works for you. There is no quick fix."

Then because his primary guy was routinely booked up, he started seeing one of the nurse practitioners each month, and this guy doesn’t ask for a test for about 9 months or so, so my hubs asks him one day, hey don’t you need a test?  So nurse practitioner says oh yeah that’s right, oops…let’s test you now. \n\nA couple days later, and hubs gets a call from the nurse practitioner who leaves a voicemail that his test was negative for Adderall, which hubs doesn’t take. He calls the nurse back, and the front desk won’t even forward him, telling him that because he’s tested negative for “stimulants”, he’s cut off and they’re dropping him from the practice.  Won’t even listen to him explain that methylphenidate isn’t the same as Adderall, and it highly depends on the type of test whether it will show both or just one.  They acted scared when he asked politely to come down and speak to the doctor or nurse practitioner in person, and we were scared they would call the cops if he did, so we dropped it. \n\nWe had to hunt down one of the doctors who used to work for that same practice, and get him set up as a new patient there.  This doctor was baffled, says wait a second I use the exact same tests…try this one…turns out negative also.  This doctor actually takes the time to look into it and reports yup, that test wasn’t one which detects methylphenidate at all.  🤦‍♀️"

    "comment": "It’s common practice to start with a low dosage, as it’s important to find the lowest possible effective dose. Concerta is methylphenidate in an extended release format. While 18mg sounds like a decent amount—and for many people it would be—it’s not like an 18mg sustained throughout the day, but rather, gradually broken down and released throughout the day. I don’t know exactly how it would be comparable, but I’m willing to bet it probably feels more or less like taking a single 5mg IR tablet.\n\nKeep with the dosage for the time being but let your doctor know you aren’t seeing much improvement. They’ll likely increase your dosage. If you end up showing no response to the methylphenidate they may eventually try one of many other stimulants (Vyvanse, Adderall, etc). \n\nI take a 56mg Concerta with a 5mg IR supplemental booster as needed (generally 2-3x per day). That’s a pretty moderate and substantive dose, but also, don’t worry about other people’s doses—with stimulants, what works for someone may not for someone else."

But you have to work with it if that makes sense? It takes awhile to figure out if its you or the meds, but in reality you're both working together, the meds will improve focus but not tell you what to focus on, that part is still up to you and it gets easier the longer you stay on the dose - on 18mg I convinced myself that the med wasn't doing anything, until I realized that I've somehow stayed on top of things, and done laundry consistently etc. \n\nToday was my first day on 56mg and I felt really wired, super focused, and dialed in (seriously, not in a good way) - I've had zero hunger cues - I feel like it may be too much but there's a lot more to it than what I've just mentioned above; \n\nI've never had high heart rate on medication, usually my HR would spike closer to 2-3pm (assuming I took it at 9am), which is also known as the \"crash\", its when the medication leaves your system and you get this rebound effect, 27mg was by far the worst of them, 18mg was bad but managble and 36mg was the most pleasant (I would still crash just not as often), with 56mg I crashed much later in the day (makes sense), but I also had elevated heart rate after taking the medication which I've never experienced before."

Took 10mg and noticed a “something”.\n\nWife is currently figuring out what’s right for her and she’s on concerta so I figured I would try an 18mg the following day to see if there was any comparisons to make.\n\nAnecdotal comparisons: there was a difference for me between unmedicated and 18mg of concerta, but it felt really “muted”, especially in comparison to vyvanses 10mg. So I’m sticking with vyvanse until I find my dose (on 40mg this week and it seems noticeably better than 30mg.) and then taking a review of where I’m at and then figuring out next steps."

It also cause me to take naps which I’ve never done before. \n\nTechnically I’m on Relexii which is a competitor to Concerta but has its own osmotic release system. \n\nThere’s a bit of a weird situation with Concerta name brand vs generic vs Relexii.  \n\nIf you have the Malinckrodt “generic” of Concerta you may not feel it as well.  It’s BX rated and doesn’t have the same release mechanism as Concerta or Relexxii (its rating was changed due to complaints but somehow stays on the market.  In the US most places don’t dispense it since they will tell suppliers not to substitute with a BX rated generic, but mistakes happen and people forget to mark boxes on order forms)."

    "comment": "I have been taking 2x10mg of Ritalin every-ish day since Sept 20th, and moved to 1x 18mg Concerta yesterday. To note, I also take 100mg Seroquel XR at night, more on that later.\n\nThe first Ritalin I took was very noticeable after around 30 minutes, I felt a very calming effect, and a mild bump to my heart rate. I also felt my right eye twitching a lot for like 10 seconds, which has never happened since, alongside a very mild euphoric feeling, which went away quickly. After around 40 more minutes I felt a significant bump to my heart rate which made me panic (was around 130bpm), but then calmed down after a little less than an hour. Taking the second one, same day, I felt the calming effect, less but still noticeable, and the heart rate bump was basically gone. \n\nThe issue is after that day, I’ve never felt the same exact feeling, which adds up according to what I’ve read, the first time is always different since your body learns to adjust to it. However I did notice that making decisions and focusing was noticeably easier, without any serious side effects whatsoever, besides the crash at night and the lesser appetite and thirst.\n\nI’ve talked extensively with my doctor and he’s suggested I take my Ritalin 30-60 minutes before food, to make sure it metabolizes properly. I don’t feel like it’s made any difference, maybe minutely so, but barely noticeable, unless I try very hard to figure out if I’ve taken it or not.\n\nOnto Concerta, taking it the first time I basically noticed nothing for the first 6 hours, except yawning and feeling tired just before that 6 hour mark, and around 6 to 6 and a half hours after taking it I notice the effects, feeling awake, easier decision making and requiring less stimuli to stay focused. However, I’m not sure if I’ve burnt out or if I just don’t feel like doing certain things I could do on Ritalin with more ease, potentially lots of factors that could come into play. Also, since my Seroquel would overlap with my Concerta, I’ve switched to 50mg Seroquel IR just after my Concerta wears off (at the 12 hour mark).\n\nI’m still exploring the medication, and having frequent communication with my doctor to make sure it’s working as intended, so I’m not sure if the lack of obvious positives and lack of side effects is due to the low dose, or the dose not working for me!\n\nEDIT: Something I forgot to mention, I have noticed being overall calmer and less fidgety, even tho I’ve got the Inattentive type, and my and anger issue have gone almost entirely away, even if my Seroquel prescription kept them on the low, the MPH has seemingly done the trick of keeping them basically at bay!\n\nTLDR: I started Ritalin quite recently, first day felt like magic - albeit some side effects, all days after that it felt kinda like nothing. I’m now onto Concerta since yesterday, and the effects are somewhat more noticeable but only after about 6 hours. Note that I’m on Seroquel as well, which kind of counteracts the MPH(methylphenidate) that’s contained in both Ritalin and Concerta, so results may vary."

The strangest thing was that my hands were no longer shaking. My hand have had a slight shake since I was a little kid!!  The first week, the 18 mg made me sleepy. After 2 weeks, I got on 27 mg, which made my heart go faster the first week. Nothing to worry about though. Did a month on 27 mg and started to feel like it wasn’t working as well and I was crashing in the afternoon, so started on 36 today. So far so good! I feel great!\n\nSo give it time.

    "comment": "I had an interesting experience of starting the instant release right before I got back genetic results for how my body metabolizes different psychiatric medicines. That turned out to be super helpful because I came back saying it worked for only 2 hours and my prescriber had the test which said my body metabolizes it poorly. For insurance reasons I need to keep trying this medication at higher doses until I can switch to things that cost more. I'm currently at 36mg on the extended release. I can sort of notice it. Mostly it just makes me smell bad which is perhaps a symptom of my body's bad metabolism for this medication. It's important to keep in mind that there's a lot of different formulations for the same medication. There's also often isotopes (dexmethylphenidate in this case). So it could be that a different formulation would work better for you too. \n\nFor what it's worth, I started with adderall and had crazy side effects in the long run but it improved my adhd symptoms so much that I was afraid to go off of the medication. I'm glad I did though because even concerta which doesn't work as well for me doesn't have the bad side effects. It's worth finding what works for you. Just know it can take a long time. Try and work with someone who will help you titrate at a reasonable speed (your body should get effects from a stimulant quickly so this isn't like waiting for results from an ssri) and don't settle if something doesn't quite work. You can always come back to it"

I’m asking for an increase next appointment because i’m still crashing bad after 4 hours. \n\ni had no negative side effects with the Adderall.

Not to mention, oftentimes, you simply can't feel it working until a week or two into taking it.\n\nADHD meds aren't a fix all thing. Think of it more like it's gonna help with many aspects of your symptoms, but you're not going to suddenly be a whole new person because of it. For me, while I'm a student, I felt more willing to do homework and chores. ADHD gives me a big \"but I don't wanna\" problem. But now I wanna."

Other meds (Straterra, Foquest, Biphentin) they just didn’t click like Concerta did for me! Moral of my story is to keep trying meds and what doesn’t work for you may be the missing puzzle piece to others :)"

We had to do one for my oldest son who is AudHD because he would not respond to the generic version of his focalin xr - the formulation simply does NOT work for him at all, after the testing the doctors had the proof that it wouldnt work, and we were able to get an exception that he has to have name brand only as that is the formulation that works for him. \n\nI just started my concerta this week - on 27mg in the mornings, I haven't felt any drowsiness from it - but I do experience mild drowsiness from my lexapro (10mg) so I take it at night. For reference though - with my wife when it comes to things like benadryl - it amps her up and makes her hyperactive, where for me it knocks me out and I take a coma nap for 8 hours after.\n\n  \nGood luck OP!"

I ignored mine for a couple decades, and now that I’ve been taking it seriously with medicine and reading books about it, a lot of stuff in the past has been making sense. I made things really hard on myself, and ruined one of my most important relationships because I was in denial. \n\nNot everything you read will be applicable to how your ADHD presents itself, not everything will be fun to read about or come to terms with, but the more you know the more you can understand why you behave and feel the way you do, then it’s all just practice and choosing how to react in a cognitive way and not an automatic response way."

    "comment": "All four you listed are filed under “CNS Stimulants” so I’ll just lump them together, even tho (lisdex)amphetamine, or Vyvanse and Adderall respectively, and methylphenidate, or Ritalin and Concerta, have their own differences. \n\nI’ll focus on the bigger question you asked. \n\nImagine CNS Stimulants as the treatment that makes your brain release the neurotransmitters that it lacks. Put simply, taking either of those causes your brain to *release more* of those, and for the medications duration, prevents your brain from sucking them back up and out of the area they need to be in to actually *work*.\n\nSNRIs and SSRIs work in a similar way, however they don’t really *release* the neurotransmitters. Serotonin in the case of SSRIs, or Selective **Serotonin** Reuptake Inhibitors, or Norepinephrine, in the case of Selective **Norepinephrine** Reuptake Inhibitors. \n\nDue to the mechanism of action of those types of medication, they don’t work as acutely as the typical CNS stimulant medications do. Rather than directly releasing neurotransmitters, they inhibit the reuptake of them in your brain, and over time lead to ideal levels of them. \n\nAlso due to their mechanism of action, you can’t just *stop taking them* out of nowhere, while with typical CNS stimulants you generally can without much issue. \n\nTLDR, imagine “CNS stimulants” as a medication to bring you up to a functional level for the medications effective duration, and imagine SSRIs, SNRIs, and NDRIs etc. as a medication to effectively change your baseline to a functional/ideal level."

I don’t know how to describe it. As a booster, it is disconcerting in the way that when Vyvanse wears off, I’m usually a pool of blah exhaustion but with adderall, I feel so calm and focused and just me. I tried it in the morning as a higher dose once and it kind of made me a little headachey and stomachachey and still trouble with executive dysfunction but still better than nothing and as a low dose booster, it’s perfect.\n\nI know people feel the opposite of me about different ones.

Of the things you listed I’ve only been on Vyvanse, though I’ve tried Asztarys which is also a methylphenidate-family medication.\n\nAsztarys *was* perfect - it gave me the ability to focus, actually dictate what I do when I want to/should do it, and quieted my nonstop internal monologue… for a grand total of 4 hours. Then it did nothing for the next week until I stopped taking it, so I can’t comment on anything relating to anxiety.\n\nVyvanse (I’ve had 20mg prescribed, then 40, and I’ll soon be upped to 50) has somewhat helped me with executive functioning, and my focus is better than usual but still lacking. While it’s done nothing for racing thoughts and the like, it’s made fighting through my anxiety a lot easier, and I’m not entirely sure how that works. The reason my dosage is being increased for the second time in a month is because it also isn’t lasting even half as long as it’s supposed to. At least this one didn’t do its thing once and then nothing afterwards.\n\nPrior to my ADHD and anxiety diagnosis, I was briefly put on Zoloft (SSRI) for depression, briefly because it made me unable to sleep at all for 2 weeks. Then I was put on Wellbutrin, an NDRI, and that worked well enough for depression so therapy could do its thing, but it did not work at all for ADHD.\n\nMaybe I’m not the best person to provide experience on this lol. My track record with psychoactive medications, in terms of reactions, is either very mildly positive, nonexistent, or utterly catastrophic. I’ve yet to find anything that makes functioning nearly as seamless as it’s supposed to be."

I felt *good.* I got shit *done.* Until 5 o'clock, where I crashed hard. I was advised not to take it on weekends or holidays. Not taking it, I felt either completely brain dead or incredibly pissed off at everything. The cons outweighed the pros and I asked to try something else\n\nStrattera: not on your list, but it was the next thing I took. It actually seemed to *mostly* improve my focus. But slowly I noticed this feeling like i was walking though mud. I started feeling depressed. My motivation plummeted and that affected my exec dysfunction. I tried Wellbutrin to offset it, but that made me feel much worse. Again, cons outweighed pros. \n\nNothing: I tried, for a time, going without any meds. (Like I had been for *forty years.*) But I'm depressed. That sloggy muddy feeling is back. Maybe it was always there and I happened to have something to overcome it, and that's gotten harder as I got older. \n\nConcerta: I'm on this now. It's the difference between feeling like mud and actually getting up and moving. It's surreal to need it. But I guess that's my life now. It helps\n Sometimes it feels like too much stimulation and my brain is more active than I need it to be. Then I feel anxious. And when it starts to wear off, I feel weird. Like a slow crash. Like you've been awake for too long, like getting up for an overnight flight. But this is every day around 5. Still, of all the things I've tried, it gives me a useful edge, and the downsides are manageable.\n\nRitalin: I was given Ritalin as a kind of \"spot treatment.\" I'm supposed to take it in early afternoon to offset that slow crash. I think it's too much; It gives that \"too stimulated\" feeling. And I even felt like my heart was beating weirdly, then felt intense anxiety about that. So I try to avoid it or do a super small dose\n\nVyvanse: never tried it"

The focus is more intense and i can feel that my heartbeat is a little shallow. food is unappealing and if i havent taken it in awhile i will be overly chatty"

I would say it takes away my mental anxiety (quiets my brain, helps me get stuck in fewer catastrophizing or self-critical thought loops) but doesn't do much for my physical anxiety. (Currently taking Buspar and hydroxyzine for that, and it works... okay. Turns down the volume on my anxiety but doesn't totally get rid of it.)\n\nI think I'm on too low of a dose right now, so it's not helping me that much with focus, but I do feel like my executive function is better.\n\nfwiw I tried SSRIs, TCAs, SNRIs, and Wellbutrin, and none of those worked out for me. Wellbutrin in particular ramped up my heart rate and anxiety to crazy levels, but I know some people do well with them!"

    "comment": "I took Ritalin (Short Acting) for around 4 years - it was the medication my paed first prescribed when I was diagnosed with ADHD. For me, they worked really well, and I have pretty severe hyperactive ADHD. I switched to Concerta about 8 years ago. Ritalin and Concerta are basically the same, as they are both Methylphenidate. The difference between them is the way the Methylphenidate is released. Ritalin is an immediate release medication, meaning that it will be most effective upon consumption, and its effects will gradually decline over a period of a few hours. The user may need to take another pill. Concerta is only available in extended-release form - Concerta appears in the form of a capsule inside another capsule inside another capsule. Think of Russian nesting dolls. Once the capsule is swallowed, it takes a while for its effects to work - this is because it needs to enter the stomach. There, the outermost capsule is broken down by stomach acid, then the capsule directly underneath it comes next, etc. This is how the effects of Concerta remain stable for so long without the user needing to take another pill a few hours later."

Brains are just different in how they process things. \n\nThis ends up being why people cycle through meds and experiment until they find the right one.

I tried that once during a very difficult time in my life, I was also working in a bar, so smiling for entitled drunk punters was often demanded. At first, it kind of worked. I felt a bit happier when I smiled. But over the course of a week, it stopped, and I started associating my deep sadness and feelings of isolation with the smile I was forcing. Which was really, really sad for me, and so the smiling only made me feel worse. Ugh. You can trick the mind like that once or twice, but I think we all know that smiling is not a happiness spell. It can stop ADHD dead in its tracks, though!"

I hope you are able to find an MD who listens to you and treats you with respect. You do deserve that and I hope his negligence doesn't prevent you from finding someone that listens."

That patronising idiot clearly doesnt know anything about the long term benefits of training and staying healthy.\n\n\nThat drove me mad, so i can barely imagine how mad you must be with your situation.

Or even better you happen to record the conversation?\n\n I would say this is absolutely reportable incident and I would report it to the state licensing board for doctors and your state or country immediately. Also reported to the office manager or the company he works for. Even if he's the owner, he might not be the soul owner or even have a majority ownership .\n\nHe likely won't lose his license unless he's got other people that I have reported on him or he's already on probation, but they would likely put him on probation make him take sensitivity classes and they usually even have to be supervised by another doctor for 6 months to a year (Just usually means that another doctor has to randomly go through five or 10% of their monthly visit notes and sign off on them and check for any issues. But it can be difficult to find a doctor willing to supervise another doctor and you usually have to pay them. However, I did find out that there are older, retired doctors that all they do is supervised doctors that aren't probation across the country. Sorry that was just a FYI for those that are curious out there. \n\nYou could definitely help prevent him from doing this to another patient as well as maybe educate him as to what he did was wrong. And if he really knows so little about ADHD maybe understand that he shouldn't be trying to diagnose it or prescribed for it in the first place."

It's the converted form of B6 and is used to make dopamine.  It's not a solo fix on its own but if your internal B6->P5P conversion has issues and is contributing to the ADHD it'll help some while you get the meds straightened out, and it'll help let you get by on a lower medication dosage later on."

The more information you can provide your doctor the better. Take the time to think about and record all your possible symptoms and related issues. Doctors are more likely to take you seriously if they can tell how much time an effort you have put into this.

Maybe it wouldn’t completely fix ADHD, but I’ve been blown away by taking vitamins in the past. In opioid addiction some doctor found that a large chunk of the withdrawal symptoms were tied to vitamin C intake, I forget the finer details apologies, but then did studies and found super high doses of vitamin C can dramatically reduce opioid acute withdrawal symptoms and post acute withdraws as well. \n\nI was extremely skeptical, at the time when I tried it I was a heroin addict of 10 years, I gave the protocol this guy made a try, and it honestly fucked me up how much of the withdrawal was eliminated with the vitamin C regiment. Still had some withdrawal symptoms, obviously there’s not really any way to come off heavy opioid use completely without some discomfort, but I’m talking made it a solid 80% better. 80% less withdrawals in that situation is literally the difference between life and death sometimes, so nothing short of miracle cure level shit. \n\nI know this is extremely anecdotal, and not really relevant besides the use of vitamins, just saying I wouldn’t knock something like that till you tried it for yourself, that’s all. I’ll be looking into it personally now that I’ve seen you mention it. \n\nEverything else that prick said was obviously horse shit, and pretty fucked up. I’ve dealt with a whole gambit of docs throughout my addiction, and I can tell you that if you don’t feel comfortable, or the doc is widely against what you say, you should just cut ties with them immediately, as that won’t change. One shitty thing about doctors is since they’re a fucking doctor they think they’re they know better than the patient no matter the context. Which obviously isn’t the case all the time, especially when it comes to really specific shit like ADHD and addiction. This means they can get pretty hard set in their beliefs, and can often dismiss the patients views in situations. We should all have a very active role in our medical needs imo, just blindly relying on another person, regardless of the amount of schooling, is essential. \n\nYou’ll be alright OP, find another GP that’ll take you seriously and you’ll be straight. I still can’t believe the fucker wouldn’t even write you a GD referral, that shit is big fucked. Good luck my friend!!"

In the changing of ideals/habits our brains have been led to believe are integral to our survival the brain often doubles down on the belief or habit and lashes out and gets much worse right before it finally lets go and allows true positive profound change to occur."

    "comment": "Many men who are still indoctrinated by these beliefs nowadays feel helpless and trapped because many of them have been raised to be helpless and trapped and are left unable to survive alone by the very system they were tricked into attributing their success to. Not on purpose mind you as women can be just as indoctrinated but while it is done with programmed \"good intent\" it's still paving the road to hell. \n\nNaturally also when we feel helpless we lash out in anger and rage and focus in on anything that will listen or feed that valid anger regardless of whether or not it's origins are actually beneficial and often entirely innocent of the fact that it may also be predatory and ill in it's intent. It's human nature to seek out that which we know to find comfort and also to aid in the processing of trauma, often not realising that by drinking from the same or similar poisonous wells we are accidentally compounding that trauma or even revictimising ourselves in the process.\n\nI if were a man raised with patriarchal beliefs I think I too would be absolutely furious realising how much of an empty power fantasy I'd been sold and just how much I'd been undermined in my ability to actually survive and live freely purely from my own merit.\n\nIt's why I think teaching young boys ESSENTIAL life skills is vital in combating this current culture of rage. Teaching things such as emotional processing and management skills, impulse control, self soothing techniques, rejection/disappointment handling techniques, conflict resolution skills, patience, cooking, cleaning, money management and budgeting, childcare, basic organisation skills, etc... All the things women within the patriarchy have had drummed into and cultivated within them since birth to make up for the deficit and ensure survival of the family unit. Responsibilities that should 100% be shared between capable prepared partners.\n\nAt the same time we cannot forget our little girls, our women and all those who don't fit neatly in those narrow catagories. Those who have been harmed to a devastating degree and yet have endured. I think feminism has evolved somewhat beyond it's original intended purpose in parts. Originally it was simply intended to grant us the agency and freedoms of our male counterparts, the ability to honour our personhoods and voices in the same way. I don't think we've fully achieved that yet on any mass scale but we've achieved it enough for some men to begin to realise that the reasons behind their feelings of disconnect, helplessness and apathy were not in fact due to women but to the very systems they once upheld that imprisoned them both in kind. We see a rise in misandry in some places where women have been traumatised and harmed to such a degree that they can no longer speak from a place of compassion or empathy. Just as worrying though in my opinion is the rise of anti feminism rhetoric in older women, it's understandable in younger girls and women because it's fed in as part of the propaganda and plays upon emotion and shame. Once you hit about 30 though, when the brain switches from more emotional to more logical thinking many women will have realised the reality of the system they were raised in and those who wish to uphold are not for men or women. They are purely for themselves as they have discovered the ways to use it to their advantage and have no qualms about those caught in the crossfire.\n\nPeople socialised as \"men\" using that system within society are being misled to think the threat is feminism or women. The true threats are the ones that actually profit without incurring much loss, that benefit from keeping that infantalising dehumanising control in place. The likes of the corporate and war machines who benefit from the dehumanisation of men, making them believe their worth can only be defined in monetary needs. Women have never profited without some form of suffering or loss within this system, some have simply learned to work within it and cunningly use it to their advantage and in some ways I can't blame them, they have no doubt paid dearly in advance and are now claiming the balance back by whatever means necessary. For me personally I find that too difficult to stomach, I do not wish to thrive at the cost of others where at all possible so I like many other women will pull away and simply love and support from a distance so as not to be further harmed or corrupted by those still caught up in the manipulations. \n\nThe tide is slowly turning and progress is progress, however difficult that may be to recognise at times. I and many others have absolute faith that men will push through and break the chains that bind them to their oppressors so that they can reclaim their personhood, not at the cost of anyone but by simple virtue of having earned it as they have always been more than capable of doing.\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk, this was supposed to be a one paragraph long agreement with your point lmao"

I take the non-generic version and have had only positive experiences, no crashing or irritability. I did have about two days of euphoria at the beginning (which was nice I guess but I’m glad it subsided) and it’s been pretty steady since. Overall positive experience but definitely talk to your doctor about the generic/non-generic difference. In most drugs it doesn’t make a difference but this one it does!!"

You just have to try it yourself and see how you go.\n\nThere is a fair few Dr's that believe higher doses are better. You can get an 84mg pill now I believe.\n\nFor what it's worth I started concerta a few months ago. At my next appointment I'll ask to try something else. Concerta fixed some issues at work but on a hole it's not great for me. I hate the crash from about 1pm till 6pm.\n\nIve tried ritalin in the past and find the effect interestingly different. Almost seems like a different drug. Ritalin is much more effective at treating me but too much of a Roller-coaster. Hate the quick up and down.\n\nI'm going to try to get in to a trial of an alternative medication. It's not allowed to be mentioned here. I believe it might work well in conjunction with concerta."

    "comment": "Seeing a lot of people mentioning the high dose.  That is certainly quite a high dose to start on, but keep in mind that ritalin and Concerta are the exact same drug with a different release mechanism.  You likely already have a methylphenidate tolerance built up.  So you are going from 40 mg all at once to 63 mg spread over 8-10 hours, of the exact same drug you are already taking. Still definitely good to check in with the doctor but I personally don't see that as a problematic dosage change."

Noradrenaline in particular fluctuates throughout the day, so having the slight peaks and troughs with 5mg of ritalin every 3 hours, but the baseline methylphenidate of Concerta so the dips are TOO low is perfect for me, seems to most closely simulate how noradrenaline and dopamine natural fluctuate throughout a day for me.\n\n Edit: saw a few people mention it below, above 18mg Concerta trashed my sleep BAD, which completely negates mediation benefits anyway. 18mg with a 12 hour half-life and the short acting ritalin seems to clear for me just fine so that I can still sleep.

It had always been a struggle on Strattera (switched from Adderall to Strattera due to stress levels at the time). I had constant apathy, dysthymia, lack of motivation, irritation, and was unable to retain information. In addition to many other issues caused by my ADD which became gradually more severe ove the past four years. \n\nNow being on 18mg Concerta, I feel like a new person. I didn't feel that typical euphoria that stimulants like Adderall can cause, but I felt motivated and at ease to do things. Clearing the kitchen table or doing dishes didn't feel like a huge all-day task either. I was able to clean my kitchen table and organize my living room! That would have been a huge task before for me- but now it was so simple. I kind of felt like crying. At work, I've found I am far more efficient getting tasks done, organizing my weeks, etc. All in all, it helps me feel normal again and I hope it will continue to do so. I don't feel a crash or irritable either unlike Adderall."

So if you've experienced any side effects with ritalin those side effects may be stronger.\n\nI did experience euphoria for a bit when I first started taking it but it stopped not long after. I've also heard it's a thing that's common when you start taking methylphenidate in general.\n\nAlso I did experience the crash when on another medication, it was some generic pill because the pharmacy didn't have concerta.(there are generic pills that are concerta but just not branded, concerta pills have text that say ALZA on them) From what I read the crash is caused when methylphenidate levels lower too quickly for the body to catch up leading to worsened symptoms. I've not experienced a crash from concerta thought. If you havent experienced a crash from ritalin you'll probably not crash from concerta.\n\nThou\n\nTLDR: I've generally has a good experience with concerta with no disruptive side effects.\n\nRitalin and concerta have the same active ingredient so side effects may be amplified due to the higher dose.\n\nI did get euphoria when I started but it stopped soon after\n\nI haven't experienced a crash on concerta but did on some generic pill."

Some people don’t like Vyvanse, but it’s what works for me. You won’t really know what works for you until you try it yourself. I went through 3 medications before I decided I liked Vyvanse best, then changed the dose like 4 times before getting it right. Takes a bit of trail and error to find what works best for you"

I’m on 54 mg currently and havnt had to change the dose for like 3 years at all. The highest I went up to was probably 54 I think I don’t remember. But anyways we tried higher one time and extreme panic attacks. Might need to play around to get the right dose where it works and where it doesn’t give you anxiety. So almost 20 years on concerta and I am at 54 mg. Hope this helps. BMI has always been 18-24 so if you have a higher one maybe that’s why? Idk I ain’t a doctor :)"

Ritalin I would crash and be super tired and irritable, concerta I don't at all, though I needed a higher dose. Mostly I just need to make sure I remember to eat as it does tend to suppress my appetite (though unfortunately not help me lose weight :/). I always realize I haven't taken my meds when I suddenly notice I'm eating a ton of food lol.\n\nThe first day I was ever on adhd meds I did have an intense euphoria, but I don't know if that was from the meds or from the feeling of being able to just DO things. I brushed my teeth and cried. It was great. I don't get that nowadays, but I can brush my teeth without existential dread, which is what I'm aiming for.\n\nGenerally, at my dose, it lasts about 10 hours for me approximately, on average. By 8pm I can usually tell it's wearing off because I'll start rambling and being distracted."

So maybe the doctor set it high cause you are used to an intense burst already. I would bring it up though and suggest trying a lesser dose first abd then increase it.  That's what my doctor would had done I presume. \n\nI find no issues aside from if I take it too late I have trouble falling asleep. Even more so now after starting Wellbutrin, so I'm gonna bring that up to my doctor."

This built into an anxious knot that basically kept me from doing anything all day, similarly to the \"Waiting Period\" that sometimes happens when you have something important you need to do... in 6 hours, so you won't commit to anything and just sit there for 6 hours.\n\nI've done 36mg since and it hasn't been that bad, but overall it's kind of a shit medication.\n\nIt may work for you, it's generally not that great though.

The crash after the effect is awful, I felt not only tired but also very angry and hungry, not a good combo.\n\nBut you could try. Its more convenient than taking more than a pill a day, you take it in the morning and forget about it the rest of the day."

I have had zero side effects except maybe low appetite, which I tend to have anyway. I have not felt intense euphoria or a crash of any kind. I’ve been taking it when I wake up every day by like 11 at the latest. I definitely feel like it’s helping so far but I could probably go up more because I’m still pretty low energy. But I’ve felt happier in general. Certain OCD things have felt less bad. I’m not where I want to be in terms of productivity, but it’s definitely better so far.

I’ve tried aderall, vivans, and Ritalin in the past. Adderal(idk how to spell. Clearly😂) made me lose my appetite almost entirely, vivans made me incredibly irritable, and Ritalin didn’t last long enough. Concerta was a happy medium. I lost a little bit of my appetite but that’s common with all the meds I’ve tried. I was able to focus long enough to do homework and it wore off in time for me to get sleep. My mood swings were kept at a minimum. The only real time I’d get bad mood swings is if I forgot to take my meds but that’s common with all meds I’ve tried. I was on concerta all throughout high school and it worked like a charm but my body did eventually build up a tolerance to it so I’ve switched to dexidrine but it took years to build up that tolerance.

I couldn't handle it, i have had a small tremor since birth, this made it worse, i was shaking so badly and i had this like sense of doom come over me. It was awful. I switched back to 36 and was good for years. Until my senior year when i ended up getting addicted to the stuff because my DR had me take another one in the PM.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni am glad to say ive been a little over a year free of this and ive been managing my ADD (im not hyperactive)"

The doc said that my body needed to get used to it and I guess it did but I still feel like there is this lingering headache that persists despite eating properly and stayed hydrated. Some days it works like a charm but some days it seems useless as I can’t focus or prioritize/plan anything. I have an exam coming up and every day is crucial for me. My headaches are like 1/3 now, I wanted to ask the community whether anyone else faces this. \n\n2 days ago the doc recommended that I up there dose (as I felt that even on the days 18mg worked, it peaked within 3 hours of consumption and wore off completely after 8.5 hours). Today I took my first 36mg dose and I can definitely feel it physically however my headache is worse and focus level and anxiety has been all over the place.\n\nI’m looking for advice and guidance (not medically ofcourse) but on other peoples’ experiences and whether there is a way to maximize the efficiency of the med or help with the headache. Also a bit concerned if I should be taking the 36mg dose tomorrow or stick to 18mg as my first day on 36 has not been the best.\n\nAny suggestions (respectable and appropriate) are welcome!\n\nThanks"

They try REALLY hard to sell you on the generics, and I have no idea why.\n\nEdit: the one you want is the only authorized generic available. It is manufactured by Actavis. If it does not say 'alza' on the tablet (here in the U.S.) then it is a fake and they are trying to give you a shitty knockoff that does not work as well, despite whatever they say.

I can’t tell you the exact difference in how they work. But there is (at least) a subtle difference. I never had Dexamphetamine. But I had Lisdexamphetamine (Elvanse) which is a prodrug of dexamphetamine. So it does the same but for a longer time. \n\nFor me the difference was that I had more energy than with methylphenidate. I attributed it to myself being able to sleep better with it (compared to taking methylphenidate, I would have slept better without any stimulants). But I also feel like it is better at suppressing the urge to sleep/take a nap. It also gave me the necessary focus and motivation to power through tasks. I also think it gives some motivation to start a task.\n\nI had 20 mg of Lisdexamphetamine (= 5,9 mg Dexamphetamine) which is the lowest available dosage. However this was the sweet-spot for me: Slight decrease in sleep quality for a decent increase in motivation and a near perfect focus.\n\nEdit: Maybe I should add the conclusion, the main difference for me to Methylphenidate was that on Methylphenidate I was always so tired that I wouldn’t get anything done (even on 5mg). So if that’s the kind of energy you were referring to, in that regard lisdexamphetamine was much better for me."

I've had better motivation with ritalin (i was taking it illicitly) so hoping concerta (prescribed) will help more. That being said, when I dissolved the elvanse into water, 15mg helped my life long depression battle and motivation a little, but i haven't experimented a huge amount as I want to wait to see how the concerta will effect me"

I was prepared to have an actual discussion, advocate for my needs if required, and ask questions to collaboratively agree on the ideal medication path. I was horrified at how callous and rude my first psychiatrist was -- it was laughable how unprofessional he was. I specifically asked for a non-stimulant, and he said a few unintelligible, super quick sentences to describe what he was writing a prescription for. I trusted that it would be ok and left, thinking the same thing as you (that at the very least, at least I got the medicine). When I pick it up, turns out he had prescribed vyvanse (OBVIOUSLY a stimulant). I was extremely disappointed that I wasted money and time visiting him, but unfortunately my therapist later told me that this is sadly very common. Apparently psychiatrists are known to lack bedside manners. \n\nThankfully in my case, I was able to pretty much laugh it off and move on (I'm still unmedicated since I haven't made moves since that incident). But for others who are suffering much more severe mental health issues and then show up to a rude and careless psychiatrist?? Honestly really tragic and really worrisome. \n\nI was expecting an experience like visiting a doctor, but sadly the standards are just not there yet. I'm sure there are great psychiatrists  out there as well, but I hear similar stories from a lot of my friends and am convinced it's part of the flawed system! \n\nI would highly advise, if you have the energy/funds, to pursue a second opinion from a different psychiatrist. Of course we should be able to expect our health care professionals to treat mental health issues with the same level of care and attention as physical health issues, but the times when they don't, is when you ESPECIALLY should."

There's a lot of things you have to be aware of like increased heart rate, potential anxiety, reduced appetite etc so you know what's \"normal\" to experience. Don't get me wrong though, they are really helpful when you find what works for you.\n\n27mg is not the highest dose of Concerta, it's not even the second highest like he said, but you're supposed to start from the lowest (18mg) and work up to what they call a therapeutic dose because you also don't want to be taking a higher dose than you need. It also doesn't last for 10 hours, more like 6-10 at a push but it's different for everyone.\n\nI'm not a psychiatrist but I'd be happy to help with any questions you have about starting on meds, I've been through the whole journey of being titrated *properly* and would be happy to share the knowledge I have"

He didn’t hesitate—he immediately said something like, “Of course you have it!” and had me take a test. Sometimes people just know. \n\nAfter that, he brought up Adderall, but sent me to another therapist to confirm the diagnosis. That second therapist basically assumed I was just looking to get high off it and refused to prescribe it. Instead, she put me on Seroquel (I think that’s how it’s spelled), and honestly, it just made me feel nothing.\n\nThis was during the pandemic. I lost my grandmother—who was more of a mother to me—and I felt… nothing. Six months later, I lost the job I’d held for 20 years, and still—nothing. That therapist eventually left, and her replacement finally saw what was really going on. He started me on a low dose of Adderall.\n\nThat changed everything. Suddenly, I could focus. I’m in school now—about 70% of the way through—and (usually) able to stay on task, though I still rely on notebooks and files to keep my thoughts organized. At my follow-up appointment, I cried. For the first time, my thoughts weren’t just swirling around—I could actually sort them out. I felt like I was accomplishing something.\n\nLooking back, I’m almost certain that whatever the first therapist put me on just numbed me and kept me stuck in a fog of depression."

    "comment": "So, as an ADHDer who is also a PMHNP student, your post is a prime example of how not to treat a client.  Because there are options, including stimulant and non-stimulant medications, they need to conduct an individualized assessment to determine which medication is the right fit for you. As well as some off-label use of other medications that can help manage ADHD symptoms.  I am glad you got your meds, but it is also horrible that he did not explain concerta and explain the risks, benefits, and side effects.  \n\nWith all of the DEA cracking down on providers, I am surprised that he did not even do a Vanderbilt ADHD screening form to justify the diagnosis.  I will also say that in many states, including the one I live in, PMHNPs can prescribe stimulants and also do a better job of assessment, for the most part.  However, there are some folks out there who just want to hand pills out and go about their day.   \n\nWhat you might want to do is see this person until you can find a better provider.  Also, if you want a full psych assessment, you may want to contact a local university that can do things on a sliding scale.  There is a difference between a full neuropsychological assessment and an ADHD assessment.  \n\nTLDR:  that sucks that you were treated like that!!"

After describing my symptoms and showing the results of my COVID test, the nurse (who works at my doctor's clinic and has access to my chart) sent in a prescription for Paxlovid. The call was less than 10 minutes, and (because Paxlovid actually works), I started getting better like 3 days later.\n\nNothing like that ever for psychiatry, though.\n\n>(I looked it up, and from what it tells me, it's actually a pretty low dose. But in the moment, out of the four he mentioned, he told me it was the second highest — which had me scared.)\n\n>Is Concerta good?\n\n27 mg of Concerta is neither \"low\" nor \"high\". 27 mg is a common starting dose for adults who are naive to (i.e., have never previously taken any form of) methylphenidate. While it isn't enough for some, for some it is a therapeutic dose.\n\nWhether it is \"good\" will depend on the specifics of your brain. Your experience taking it will be unique.\n\nI take Concerta personally (36 mg) and it works pretty well for me. Having said that, it can be easier to get stuck in hyperfocus with it, and if you find it's hard to sleep you should discuss dropping to a lower dose or using a shorter-lived version like Ritalin if you find methylphenidate works for you. Concerta is an all-day med, and you may still be \"on\" well into the evening... possibly later than you want to be. On the other hand, it can also be great to crash around bedtime and just ride the wave into dreamland.\n\nIf it doesn't work, higher doses are available, as are other medications that may work better for you."

Basically I had talked it all out with my therapist and then told my psych what we were thinking, she agreed and I was on my way."

If I were you I'd see about going to see a different psychiatrist, that one sounds like bad news. \n\nJust speaking on my personal experience - I have both social anxiety and ADHD, which my psych took into account when figuring out my prescriptions (got diagnosed with both at the same time). After my first consult, he ended up just prescribing me a bunch of low dose XR Adderall in addition to my Lexapro, so I could try out a few different dosages and see what worked best for me, and I ended up settling with 10 mg XR. We meet up every few months on Zoom to check in and make sure I don't need any changes/am doing well, so far I haven't needed to make any changes. \n\nAlso - if you're looking for a medication with less significant spikes/crashes, it might be a good thing to consider an XR version of whichever medication you end up on."

My current psych talks with me for about 30 minutes each time when she has no reason to. She’s not a therapist or that’s not the service she provides technically. But I told her I appreciate being able to talk with my provider as my first one would shoo me out the door in 7 minutes. We both are in healthcare so we talk about that and I share with her different things ngl like a child sharing a success story with a parent. We’re like the same age.

They don’t seem to need any history or back story if you’ve already given that information to a therapist that diagnosed you and referred you to psychiatry for medication. Seems like you had expectations for a totally difference experience and came over prepared to explain yourself and that’s okay. Just know that your psych will primarily need to know how you react to the meds and if they’re helpful or not and they will adjust from there. I’m sorry if you felt that he was perhaps dismissive but no need to let that discourage you. Now you know what to expect. Just keep track of how the meds go for you and come with a list of questions and concerns about the meds for your next appointment.

I don't fully remember what they were, but atleast he had more than just answering question) \nAnd when I was told that I got diagnosed I was in a room with my psychiatrist and we had videocall with the doctor(?? Not sure if it's doctor , but let's call it that for now) who asked some more questions and the just asked \"What do you think about the medicines?\" (And ofc  she told about the therapy etc. at some point) And because I aswered that I would want to try them and see, if they would help, she just aswered someway like \"Okay I'll describe you Concerta, take it this and that way and discuss about the control appointment with your psychiatrist.\"\n\nAnd when the video call ended, I even had tl ask my psychiatrist \"So, did I get the diagnosis ?\"  😂\nAnd luckily with her I talked little bit more about what kind of changes I should keep on watch in terms of side effects and if the medicine even helps. \n\nI don't remember for sure, when my psychiatrist face to face appointments ended, but atleast I changed in that time to Medicinet CR, but when the face to face ended I had to do phone calls with the doctor which were again very fast and confusing 😅 Luckily the doctor changed to psychiatric nurse and now it much easier to actually talk about my experience, because with the doctor I didn't even realise that I had to change my medicine again, because I didn't have the time to remember to check my notes when I was on a call with her.🫠\n\nAnd for my brother, I'm not sure if his test was longer just because he also got diagnosed with autism, but 🤷‍♀️\n\nAnd even tho I was slightly scared and frustrated in the begining and had very bad impostor syndrome.

Personally, I did a ton of research before choosing a medication management provider. I went to my local city subreddit and searched for “medication management” and “psychiatrists” posts within there. The place I found is semi new age/hippie but also traditional and my provider is actually an NP who has specific training and licenses for medication management. It’s becoming more common nowadays for medication management providers to go the NP route because it’s less intense training/education.\n\nMy first appt was about an hour. It was like an interview where we discussed my medical history,  my lifestyle, my stressors, and what I wanted to address. We then discussed different medication options and their effects and side effects and made a plan to start one and follow up in 2 weeks to see how it was going. I started 10 mg vyvanse and have now worked up to 30 mg after trying 20 mg. The experience I’ve had is what you should expect from a medication management provider. However, full disclosure, I already had an ADHD diagnosis after having an autism and ADHD evaluation done by a psychologist. It was expensive and took a whole day for the evaluation but I feel really good about having an official diagnosis and not having to feel like I have to prove it to any other medical professional.\n\nSorry again you had that awful experience.

Feel free to try the Concerta non-stims work for plenty of people alone or in conjunction with a stim med.

I didn't come very prepared to my first psychiatrist appointment. I had just recently gotten diagnosed and I was really struggling so I was solely focused on convincing the guy I needed it. I shouldn't have worried though. He had me describe my struggles for 3 minutes and then prescribed me a low dosage of medikinet to start me out with. My follow up appointments were much the same. I felt like I couldn't voice anything negative about the meds (nothing like side effects, more the ways in which the effects were unsuited for my lifestyle), because I should just be grateful I got them. Also the half yearly check up sessions of 10 minutes didn't feel like a space where I could express these thoughts. It didn't feel like the psychiatrist was working with me, more like he was trying to get my appointment over with. The only explanations I ever got were legally mandatory ones. Eventually I just stopped taking my meds and visiting his office and it made my life tough. \nAll this to say, I feel your pain. Psychiatrists are busy, but please keep insisting on your rights and if these meds don't work for you, tell him. If all appointments with him are like this, maybe you need somebody new (easier said than done I'm aware). I think I'm also ready for a second attempt at psychiatrists and meds soon."

    "comment": "*Psychiatrists* prescribe meds, they aren’t very qualified to do therapy—my monthly med appointments are max 10 minutes. These guys are doctors, so you’re more likely to have interactions where they get to the chase without the fluff. As for meds stuff, they can’t really tell you too much bc everyone reacts to meds differently.  It’s very trial and error. If it doesn’t work, you tell them and try something else. But Concerta is a long acting medication—it’s less likely to cause you to crash than other short acting meds. (For example, with Adderall there are 2 versions: a regular release and an extended release.)\n\n*Psychologists* are the therapists who you talk to and are more emotionally in tune. They can’t prescribe you meds b/c they’re not doctors."

Many are like that, the he is paid to write scripts. my doctor is the same way, when I talk about personal issues, she says seek therapy.  I thought that was what i was doing, why book all this time to write a script, and be down 5-10 min later.  So when i did seek a therapist (who does not write scripts), boy was there a huge difference.  After a few phone sessions, I found talking it out to someone, life really was not that bad, and my experience and feelings battling AFD are common.  After a few weeks of postive reinforcement I went  from getting help and feeling better to man, these calls are too long and boring.  So one gets paid to write to find the right pill, if doesnt work, the answer, write a script and change it.  The other gets paid to give you there time.   And they dont like cutting calls short, but 5 min before your time is up, they shut it down as its time move on the next therapy session.  Hang in there!"

Because she only had availability to see me every 5-6 weeks, I probably only had 6 or so sessions with her before I was able to switch to a therapist who could see me more regularly. At one of my last sessions with my first therapist, I told her that I was pretty sure I had ADHD. That’s when she had a lightbulb moment and said, “That makes sense! It sounds like you *do* have ADHD!” Not sure what tipped her off: the fact that I was late to almost every single appointment, or the fact that I couldn’t stay on one topic for more than 5 seconds. 😂"

It can feel surprisingly hurtful in the moment, even if the person thinks they're being supportive by not treating it like a big deal. We can build these things up in our heads, and feel like we have to justify every aspect of it, because we've been on the journey of figuring out ourselves alone and all the emotional turmoil and agony of that. So, when it's brushed off as NBD, it can feel like an affront to that. But the fact is, the other person hasn't really thought that much about it, and have no idea of the expectations you have for it. It's... a common faux pas 😅"

I say that both for the people struggling to get the proper medication and care, and the people who need care and are unable to receive it.\n\nYeahhhh, it definitely wasn’t what I was expecting.\n\nI completely agree. What I had in mind was something more like a therapist appointment. Not with all the emotional baggage, but with back-and-forth conversation. Them asking me questions, me answering, actual dialogue. That’s what I was prepared for. But that didn’t happen.\n\nAs a matter of fact, I felt  that if I were just someone trying to get high, I could have lied, said I \"tried\" something before and that it didn't work, and he probably would have prescribed me Adderall. I know that probably wouldn't have happened but that's HOW I FELT. It seemed he just wasn't listening and before the session already made up is mine that he was giving me this specific medication. \n\nEven worse, (or better I guess), an hour after the session my insurance told me my medication was ready to be picked up. It felt like I was treated as a number. A quota he had to meet and check off by the end of the day, and then just moved on.\n\nThe only thing that’s making me semi-confident is the fact that, from what I’ve read, Concerta is considered one of the more mild stimulants. And I’m on a low dose. So I’m trying to hold onto that and the idea of, \"Well, it's a low dose, what's the worst that can happen? At least I'm getting treated.\" I’m trying to separate the art from the artist here, trying to remind myself that just because the doctor was rude and semi-unprofessional doesn’t mean the medication won’t help. Only time will tell."

I got up to the max of 90mg and when i asked for more, I realized it may be more of a personal management issue at that point rather than pure adhd. Since then I weaned down to 0mg for a year and that was fine until one day i just couldnt stay awake for more an an hour at a time without needing an ungodly amount of food or sleep for energy. I am back on the meds and i hover between 18 and 36mg doses with no major issues. Honestly it is odd they didnt start you off on the minimum dosage. All this being said, each medication acts differently to every individual.

I was ready to defend my suspicions with my life, but was also almost looking forward to discussing these things with an expert-- I felt it would have been cathartic. And I ended the appointment, despite getting the diagnosis I was expecting and hoping for, feeling incredibly...unseen. \n\nWe have a five minute or so check in every few months so I can get refills.

If you've been to a therapist prior or currently it's possible your psychiatrist read their notes or even called them beforehand and knew your background already. \n\nAlso concerta isn't a controlled substance so the bar is much lower to prescribe it and just see if it helps. \n\nAnd the last thought I have is you may have just really been giving off the distracted ADHD vibe so strongly that he decided he'd seen enough. Keep in mind he's probably treated hundreds of people with ADHD in his career and he may have just clocked you. \n\nAll that said the responsible thing I'd expect from a good psychiatrist would still be an interview about your history and experiences to last most of the call then a discussion about the medication options and time for questions. Some even would want multiple sessions to diagnose. Despite all of this I will say that even when it's an hour long session I found I still felt like a drug seeker because it seems to easy that I put off a diagnosis for so long only to get meds to treat it that work in an hour."

They kept leaving for other practices because (as many of them told me on their last appt with me) that they were given so little time with each patient, it was always back to back and they rarely had time to get to know a patient enough to build that trust and understanding with them to treat them in a way they felt good about.

It was great, until the insurance again got snitty with it. “You need to fail out of XYZ class meds before we’ll pay for it.” I was maxed out on all Ritalin and its derivatives for dosing. It was effective, but I was maxed out. My daughter was also on relatively high doses of this as well. She was still having issues. Someone suggested a genetic test to see if it was the best med class for her to be on. Lo and behold, it wasn’t. Her genetic makeup has X genetic alteration that makes it so she will need much higher doses of the Ritalin (methylphenidate) class of meds. I switched her to Adderall. She needs a much much lower dose for efficacy.\n\nI took the same genetic test and she inherited this trait from me! I switched to the Adderall class and it’s working great!"

We don't understand it completely yet we can only see what goes in and what comes out. This applies to therapeutic efforts as much as medication. But for medication especially we know which medication helps for which symptom but for a variety of reasons out of our control it might not be effective for a specific patient.\n\nIn my case my psychiatrist put me through about 10 different antidepressants. Because he was trying to medicate my depression. It took me some time to realize I might have ADHD and get tested for it. And after that in hindsight it makes a lot of sense that all the antidepressants didn't really help because depression wasn't the primary problem. \n\nSo while it doesn't excuse carelessness, trial and error is really quite common when it comes to medicating mental illness."

I was constantly having to stop for breath, and my Fitness App was showing my heart rate at a consistent 180-190BPM. I was the only one with a heart rate that high. Ride after ride.\n\nAfter being properly medicated, I realized my rides just felt easier. I wasn’t hesitating on the downhill features anymore. And I realized I was climbing much more easily. I couldn’t figure out why. It wasn’t until about a month later that I decided to check my Fitness App sessions. My heart rate dropped by about 17BPM after I started my meds. I checked every ride before, and every ride after. It was consistent. My heart rate hasn’t gotten near 190 again.\n\nIt turns out, being unmedicated makes me into an anxious wreck of a person, which was spiking my heart rate and negating my ability to “think quick” in fast, downhill situations. I would have never guessed that ADHD medicine would affect something like heart rate during exercise. Especially since it’s a stimulant, which I assumed would have the opposite effect."

I was also pounding coffee all day to make up for the other symptoms and that compounded the overstimulation. I (wrongly) assumed before I tried it that medication was a stimulant also but prescription strength so it would probably feel like drinking a little too much coffee all day. I found out it was closer to slowly drinking a cup of green tea.\n\n2. I stopped hitting my head on things all the time. I generally have very good spatial awareness for instance when parking a car. But when it came to my body it was not great. My vision compensates for the worst of it but everything above my eyes I can’t see and my apparently my brain cannot remember there is important stuff there. So anytime I am in close quarters with something like plugging something in under furniture or digging through a low shelf I will inevitably hit my head both coming and going even though I made a note of it after the first one. Somehow my head just gets out of the way now."

It's easier for me to fall asleep, stay asleep (or quickly fall back to sleep if I do randomly wake up in the middle of the night), and get up the morning. \nMy doctor likes to make stupid comments like \"most people don't take stimulates to help them sleep.\"  🙄 Yeah, Kevin, and most people's brains don't try to fight the urge to sleep at night ( day time naps are 100% acceptable according to my brain) because it's \"boring\" or because they are overly tired. To then fight them to wake up because in the morning, no matter how many hours of sleep I get. All because my brain says, \"I don't wanna.\" And you know what, Kevin, that sound logic of 'I don't wanna' normally wins no matter how much I protest. \n\nHonorable mentions: \n-lack of urge to drink/able to stop and not go on a bender at a drop of a hat\n-Able to text people in a way that is more understandable\n-able to keep my cool more easily ( emotions don't feel like I'm going 0 to 90 in 2 seconds flat)\n-Don't feel the constant urge of needing hurry with what I'm doing. Like, I can actually wait in a line now\n-I can read books even if I'm not crazy about the topic \n-I can stop in the middle of a project with only mild irrigation and pick right back up later without all hope being lost\n-easier to not binge eat or constant snack\n- I can be around people and just sit\n-I can smoke without having a full anixity mental breakdown. I still smoked, just didn't say ANYTHING, and thought everyone was dealing with it too, but just handling it better than I could. \n\nNow that I really think about it, the craziest thing I've noticed about taking medication is that it's easier for me to live the life I actually want and be okay with the person I am. It's like I was finally able to see how it was controlling so much of my life that I thought was just normal everyday life and struggles."

I assume it has something to do with sensory gating, or not enough norepinephrine in my somatosensory cortex.\n\nI used to pull hot things out of the microwave, or wash dishes with the water as hot as it could go. Other people weren't able to touch the hot things like I could. I never knew why, but once I tried medication, the sense of touch (and pain) normalized, and I had about the same heat pain tolerance as everyone else around me. To be clear, once the meds wear off, my sense of touch is hyposensitive again. It makes it extremely easy to tell if my meds have kicked in / worn off. I just rub my fingertips together.\n\nAs far as I can tell, this is not very common."

And these are measured always 2.5- 3 hours in when the concentration of the meds in my blood has just peaked and I presume this I the effect of the reduced stress and perhaps better sleep quality.

I had also been diagnosed ADHD (shout out to my mom and her psych undergrad catching and then helping me be one of the few women diagnosed as a child even though I wasn't hyperactive), but most doctors focused more on the trich as a separate thing since it was causing greater distress. Which is fair seeing as I had bald patches and skin issues, but most of said treatments were attempts at behavioral therapy and habit breaking that just wouldn't stick.\n\nThe turning point of probably my entire life was when one decided to focus on the ADHD, theorizing that my anxiety and depression were a result of the trich and not the other way around. It seems obvious to me now, but that was such a game changer. I didn't magically stop all picking, but the ADHD treatment made it possible for me to actually implement the behavior therapy."

    "comment": "This might be weird but everyone else relates ik they do bc you’re all saying exactly the thoughts in my head. So 1. I actually know how it feels to be hungry, and how it feels to need to poop. I used to just feel blaring pain and go down the list of things to find out. But now I can ACTUALLY feel relief after using the bathroom because now I know the problem is that I need to poop. \n\nAnd 2. Emotional regulation is crazzzyyyyy on vyvanse. I literally would get angry, upset, or just irrationally irritated from anything and everything. Everything made me sad in some way, and my emotions were in hyperdrive all the time. Now I’m calm and collected, and things still get to me but not NEARLY as much as before. Like I’ll feel sad, but it’s FOR a sad reason, not for NO REASON. I LOVE IT. \n\n3. Someone said misophonia. Yes bro omg. Sounds, lights, my visual and audio processing. SMELLS. I HATE ALL SMELLS. But now? I can suddenly tolerate everything. I still have heavy autism so it’s not completely gone but it’s WAYY more tolerable than before. And in terms of my processing of senses, I do NOT have the option to stop taking in things. Usually some/the majority of people without adhd can just ignore things I guess? They take in too much information and their brain spits out what they don’t need. But I notice that me and some other people with adhd or autism or both, can’t just pick and choose. The brain tells us ALL of it is important, but 100% of the time, we don’t have the storage to hold all of it in. I’ve notice my vyvanse gives me more “storage” per se. I still don’t have the option to stop noticing literally every single little thing, but there’s definitely more happening. Like imagine you’re at Publix and 100 people are trying to check out and there’s just one cashier. The speed of people doesn’t change and if you don’t do something, the store might as well just explode because of all the people it’s trying to check out. Now I have like 10 more cashiers and I don’t get so overwhelmed by the sheer amount of senses that my brain is picking up. Sure I’m still getting such an influx of information but now I ACTUALLY have the storage and the processing ability to keep up. I CAN ACTUALLY KEEP UP WITH MYSELF. LIKE OH MY GOD, I WAS BASICALLY A 2000’s MONITOR AND COMPUTER WORKING WITH INPUTS COMING FROM A QUANTUM COMPUTER. LIKE NO SHIT IM SO TIRED ALL OF THE DAMN TIME. \n\n 4. Relating to the last sentence from point 3, I don’t use as much energy processing and everything like before. And that directly translates to my sleep. My brain isn’t exhausted by the end of the day and when I sleep, I get so much more recharged than before. I’ll wake up in 4 hours completely rested. I still get terrible anxiety and am terrified of not sleeping enough because of the consequences that it caused when I was unmedicated. But that’s more emotional than anything and I’m slowly getting used to actually being able to get things don’t on smaller amounts of sleep. But yes oh my god I don’t have to sleep an ungodly TWELVE TO LIKE TWENTY HOURS, just to feel like I’ve slept THREE??????? I love it so much oh my fucking god. \n\n5. And my last point, my speech and my verbal communication skills. Since the meds make my train of thought slower and more consistent, I’m not constantly veering off point or stuttering like a car coming to a screeching stop. And my choice of words too??? I’m so much more verbally fluent and it makes it so much easier to function in the world around me where everyone is spitting out words and I can’t figure out which person I’m supposed to pay attention to. Like wow I just heard that Jerry from 20 feet away broke up with his girlfriend but say that again because even though I caught it the first time, there were way too many things in my net to find what I actually needed to understand so I had to throw all of it away and restart. I can just talk and it doesn’t take an extra 80% effort just to raise my voice enough for people to hear me. I’m not so insanely focused on the other persons face and reactions that as I’m speaking, based on their facial changes suggesting certain emotions, I’m not changing my entire thought or point I’m trying to explain to keep them happy. I would do that like 8 times in just one sentence and it would come out as something that sometimes made no sense to me but made the other person happy, then sometimes made no sense to me OR the other, then sometimes that made sense to ONLY me and not the other. Which would result in me trying to say it again in a completely different format while also doing the whole process all over again.\n\n\nIt’s crazy because this directly affects how I feel and act when I’m UNMEDICATED. More energy gotten from sleep makes me not so exhausted throughout the day. More processing speed gives me a lot more space to work with when the medication wears off and even the next day. I’ve learned so much about myself and what I need versus what I was forcing myself to do in order to keep up with everyone, so now when I’m unmedicated I can forcefully take it easier on myself and use strategies from other people with adhd or asd and they actually work! I’ve stopped fighting myself about how I function!!!!!"

At duck I would have to retreat until mosquito time was over, even if they won’t bothering anyone else, they would be coming after me.  \n\nI started taking meds, and… nothing, they just stopped bothering me entirely.\n\n\nHere’s one explanation: \n\t•\tMosquitoes are attracted to a combination of cues: body heat, carbon dioxide, body odor (from skin microbes), and certain chemicals released in sweat or on the skin.\n\t•\tStress can change your body chemistry—including how much lactic acid and other skin-secreted compounds are present. These changes can make you more attractive to mosquitoes.\n\t•\tStudies have shown that stress, exertion, or hormonal changes can increase attractiveness to mosquitoes, possibly by altering body temperature, sweat composition, or CO₂ output.\n\nThe physical effects of stress can make you more noticeable and appealing to them."

I also eat a bit healthier now and lost weight (about 40-50 lbs).\n\nThe only bad part is when I’m PMDDing, I have to take progesterone cream in order to get the ADHD meds to work.

I actually slow down and listen to others when they talk. I'm not sure if this is different, but I noticed it.\n5) I have way more patience now and everyone comment on how I can be so chill.\n6) I don't drink alcohol every day or in excess like before\n7) I don't make a lot of risky decisions. (This was a big one) I was an extremist, always up for fun, and my motto was, \"WHY NOT?' and I never waited for an answer.\n8) With medication, I could actually slow down and sit. This was a big one! I always had to be in motion. It was killing me. My body was tired, but I had to keep moving. My medication slowed me down and let me actually think at a normal pace, which made my body move at a normal pace. Sounds crazy but stimulantes do slow down people with ADHD. That's how you know you have it.\n10. My medication helped me focus on one task at a time instead of all 10 or 20 at the same time.\n\nWhat it didn't do for me:\n\nMy mood was pretty much the same. I did become more confident because I didn't feel like such a space cadet anymore. Truthfully, I enjoy not taking my medication when I don't have to so I can feel like 'myself' again. That was the person I had known for 30 years, so it's nice to run around and be silly. A lot of ADHD is just a lot of goofing around and being a big kid, so I miss that. HOWEVER, I would not give up my medication because that's just not functional for me. \n\nMedication isn't for everyone, you can exercise and get the same effects as medication. I just don't have time to do 3 hours of exercise each day and that's what my body needs to function properly. I get 1 hour 3/4 days a week of exercise and I cut my medication in half. It works for me."

Finally started to treat the ADHD and BAM regular bowel movements. I still get the occasional flareup, but adderall helps so much in keeping things moving at a more normal baseline. \n\nThat being said, I DO have to be careful not to take it on an empty stomach because otherwise it hits my system too fast and causes the, sometimes horrifically painful, emptying cycle. I quickly found out that it has to be the XR for the same reason."

I believe it runs in our family. Both his parents had it and were not medicated either. Made growing up in my home super chaotic. \n\nI’ve had my own obvious struggles and am now taking steps to get a formal diagnosis and medication.

Alcohol is one example, as even though it will effect you, you won't feel as drunk as you are and it does the same thing for all sorts of other substances. \n\nI think this may also play some role in people medicated for ADHD developing less addictions than un-medicated because several of the things we could be addicted too just don't work as well while we are on out meds.\n\nEdit: for clarities sake, this is not saying you can use stimulants to drink more or take other substances. Said substances can interact with your meds in dangerous ways, and in the case of alcohol feeling less drunk tends to lead people to drink more and get alcohol poisoning. Just because you don't feel it as much doesn't mean it isn't effecting you"

You can take atomoxetine which is a non-stimulant. Methylphenidate is probably safe too if you don't go with a very high dosage and experiment irresponsibly. At least I haven't noticed any issues when occasionally stopping it (apart from the damn symptoms resurfacing, but even those are not *that* bad any more because I've already rewritten some mental habits, although they do seem more visible now and irritate me more, just like when you left a toxic relationship and after a while have to talk to that person again)."

I can't remember if my sinuses were any better when I was trialled on Adderall over a decade ago... \n\nJust recently I've had a CT scan, & at-home sleep test, all trying to finally get my breathing (snoring) figured out, & with the aim of seeing a specialist for a septum operation. Because holy f is it bad. I'm a 100lb woman & I snore like a drunk uncle! All this is currently prioritised over my seeking ADHD treatment -- but what an awesome bonus, if I do have that side-effect once prescribed!\n\n(Also, if you're really worried about PAWS or any kind of withdrawals, maybe open a discussion here? I believe the whole only-when-you-really-need-it view on stimulants is outdated, & addiction / withdrawal is not the problem we once thought it could be. There are plenty of people here who forget their meds, who use every day, who take breaks, etc etc, & all with different experiences, many with different advice from different doctors.)\n\nLet us all know how you go, sinus-wise & otherwise, once you start with your meds! 💜🐨"

The lady at the sleep centre place told me to exaggerate some symptom items on the checklist just so I could get it covered by gov Medicare (Australia), since I'm not overweight, middle-aged, or a dude. Anyway, test showed severe apnoea, CT showed messed up septum, now just trying to get to the next stage ... with a doctor I rarely see because I'm so disorganised & stuck all the time with my (undiagnosed, untreated) ADHDness, basically. I figured it would be surgery...\n\nAnyway! I guess it makes sense that stimulants have decongestant effects, since pseudoephedrine (for cold/flu) is one. But also, it's not gonna fix your septum or whatever else is going on. I'm glad the CPAP is having that bonus benefit for you, in terms of managing ADHD; obviously poor sleep is exacerbating things for me at the moment. Sleep is so important for so many reasons, but that would be a huge part of it for me. Poor sleep is also, more critically, a huge risk factor for my epilepsy -- but day-to-day, that generally doesn't affect me too much, defs not so much as ADHD.\n\nSorry for kinda just thinking out loud about it all. So good that you've improved so much. Definitely living a bit longer now! You've given me some really good info, something to discuss further with my GP. Cheers, mate 🐨"

Also it didn't have much of a positive effect on my productivity or task salience.\n\nA few months ago I was switched to concerta 18mg. And it's been quite effective. The side effects are mild. I do have a crash around mid day and evening, but I work around it by scheduling my down time during those periods. \n\nThe advice I've heard from others is that not every medication works for everyone. It takes time and experimentation to find the right one for you.\n\nSo try different things until you find the right fit.\n\nP.S. once you do find the right one, please keep in mind that it won't be a silver bullet. The first 2 weeks will be exceptional (especially if it's a stimulant) but after that the magic will wear off and you'll feel like it's not working.

That means none of the generics can recreate the same kind of slow release. When I was jumping around some generics after my pharmacy stopped using the \"authorized generic\", I would get wild wild side effects and huge crashes. One of the generics gave me serious thoughts of no longer existing every day about 3 pm. I was able to get back on actual Concerta and it is stable and I have no side effects or end of day crash like I did with the generics. \n\nSo, before you try other medications completely, ask to try the authorized generic or the brand name Concerta. It might be the solution for you like it was for me. \n\nI've also tried a few other meds, and none of them worked to keep me as stable as actual Concerta has."

I was initially hesitant to try stimulants because of some other health issues that I wanted to get clearance from another specialist to make sure stimulants wouldn't make things worse for me. So, maybe that set a good tone for her evaluation of me, but I've also never heard of anyone getting drug tested for stimulants? I do kinda live under a rock at times, so that may just be me, but even if drug testing is normal, as other commenters have pointed out, Adderall doesn't stay in your system super long. I believe there's an extend release version, but even that doesn't last more than a day. Antidepressants typically take a few weeks or longer to start seeing a difference, but ADHD meds tend to be pretty fast acting.

Rian just decided he couldn't afford his ADHD meds or justify spending the money on it.\n\nI couldn't afford to pay for his meds off-insurance (and he wouldn't have accepted the money from me - I tried) but I could give him a little of my meds. He would not sell his own meds to anyone, and he worked night shift to help his parents.\n\nI had a couple other friends who helped contribute from time to time but for those six months before his mom beat cancer and could go back to work, I gave him enough to survive.\n\nIt wasn't the smartest thing to do, but it was what I could do at the time. I did manage get a backup supply for three months because I was able to afford both a prescription off insurance and my doc trusted me when I said I lost most of a bottle down the crappy dorm sinks when it opened weird, and I asked if I could have a supply to store at my parents' house (they knew my doctor socially) so I could make sure I had spares if I needed them.\n\nThe thing is, the doctors don't want you to treat your meds like a resource for other people. \n\nWhen I was in college, I was approached several times to sell my pills for $10 each to students who wanted the extra edge and I always refused. This is back in the early 2000s, so it's not like it was HARD to get diagnosed with ADHD at the college clinic, the issue really just came down to people wanting to pop a couple of amphetamines for a long weekend of studying without understanding how it works. And also, $10 back then is approximately $20, give or take a few cents now. \n\nI could have easily sold a month's supply of my meds for $900 total so long as I didn't get caught.\n\nI actually had a small, secured-to-the-concrete hotel-style safe in my dorm room that my roommate and I kept our meds in for that reason alone (he had ADHD as well. We rode for a semi-pro cycling team, and we both had stashes of Percocet and 800mg ibuprofen as well because of past injuries, in addition to some expensive medical supplies. And we had thieves in our dorm that thought nothing of breaking into a dorm room to steal stuff.\n\nOnce it came out that we actually had legal drugs that could give you an edge and also keep you functioning after a 50mph wipeout and road rash, we were continuously telling people to fuck off into the sun, we weren't giving them drugs for any reason whatsoever.\n\nRoomie and I never shared our drugs with each other, either. Rian was the absolute only time either of us gave them away.\n\nIt's a thing that a lot of people with ADHD have done simply because their peers think they can buy them off their friends with the condition. Especially when you are in your late teens or early 20s, the temptation to make money in college is strong, especially when the demand for the drugs you take is that high.\n\nThat's why they tell you not to sell it or share it. It's not because they don't trust you. It's because frankly, you COULD sell it very easily to people who want it because they think it gives them an edge. \n\nIt's not personal. It's just a thing they have to say.\n\nThat being said, it sounds like your provider is unaware of how the pharmacology of ADHD medication works. I've been screened before without it in my system and they asked why. I was explicit and said, \"because I ran out last week and you wouldn't provide a scrip without a urine test. Chances are it's not in my urine test because it won't show after 4 days.\" In general, a decent physician will nod and go, \"yeah, I get that\". \n\nMy recommendation here is pretty simple: find yourself a different primary care physician or doctor. One that is willing to work with you on medication and your treatment. \n\nYou are not STUCK with your GP any more than you're stuck with an electrician or plumber that does shitty work and doesn't listen to you. You have options (unless you actually don't due to living in a rural area experiencing a lack of medical care options, thanks a lot Donald. And in that case man, I am sorry, but I highly recommend trying to find a GP that will work with you and do telehealth appointments ven if you have to drive an hour to get there). You don't have to stay with a GP that won't listen to you. It's a pain in the ass to change docs, but believe me it is worth the effort in the long run, especially if you find one that you keep as your doc for 15-20 years. \n\nSo TLDR:\n\n1. It's not personal, but this is also someone who is unreasonable and reactive.\n2. Don't sell/gift your meds. I mean, duh.\n3. If your doctor says you didn't have them in your system, remind your doctor that you did not have them in your system because you ran out a week ago. Provide them with actual information they can use to justify the gap.\n4. If they don't take you seriously and accuse you of lying, look for a GP that **will** work with you. You CAN fire your doctor if you feel they are not providing adequate care, and you can also leave a review of your issue online, with their clinic feedback. \n\nIn short, this doc has accused you of a felony - selling your meds. So you should not EVER try to work with them again. That's just not only uncool, it's unprofessional, and this doctor is not one you should ever trust with your mental or physical health, ever again.\n\nFor real. Fuck them, fire their ass, find someone who will work with you and who doesn't have an agenda against prescriptions that actually make your life better."

If they want to curb drug abuse they need to educate people, not dictate to them. Drug abusers face their own consequences through health and lifestyle degradation, laws should limit their impact on others but not their sovereignty. Pathways to recovery and true information made available to the public are the only real solutions. \n\nIf our medication weren't a controlled substance, we wouldn't need to negotiate with narcissists from the disadvantaged position of being unmedicated. Many of us are adults, capable of determining for ourselves whether or not the effects are beneficial, and ultimately we're the deciders as to whether or not to pursue medication, knowing that eventually we will find a doctor that agrees.

It's not illogical to assume that a physician should know how long a drug remains in your system and act accordingly. \n\nA patient shouldn't be expected to know how long the drug will remain in their system, nor should they be expected to play games and hoard pills. That's literally the opposite of what is supposed to happen. The patient is supposed to take them as directed and trust that the prescribing doctor knows what the hell they're doing."

This applies even more to IR forms as opposed to XR forms. It the difference between a shot and a beer. They are the same dose but the concentration matters. \n\nThe issue is “needing” or “wanting” the rush. It shouldn’t be the point. The point should be cleaning your room and getting to work on time. Plugging in your phone or answering a text in time.\n\nIt increases heart rate, constricts your blood vessels, dehydrates you, etc.\n\nSorry to go off but I’m so sick of having this stigma every month, every visit, ever piss test after 15 years of logged prescription use verified by multiple psych and PCP.\n\nHard to imagine amphetamine would be so tiring."

I was hormonal, dealing with all the body change shit, on top of already feeling iffy about being the heaviest I'd ever been. It was very triggering. Thank goodness my husband helped me through it.\n\nAt my next appointment, I saw a different OBGYN who was so much nicer. She saw the weight gain, smiled at me, and said, \"You'll lose the weight. This is temporary. It's for baby. You're fine.\" She noted my history and assured me that since all of my vitals and baby vitals were perfect, there was no reason for concern. THAT'S how you doctor."

He came back, and asked me what I thought. \n\nI honestly told him I hadn't noticed I had gained more than usual, typically I hit 60/61 kg tops and then adjust my eating and exercise habits when I realise I'm uncomfortably overweight. He was great about it and asked me a few questions to check I was ok mentally, was setting myself realistic and healthy changes, and apologised if he had offended me in anyway. I reassured him that he hadn't, I don't weigh myself very often, I have a limit to what is comfortable for me and was genuinely surprised I had passed that \"acceptable\" (for me) point and appreciated it being pointed out. For me, that was a respectful and tactful way of finding out where someone is at weight wise- are they aware and happy with where they're at, aware and unhappy, or happy but oblivious. \n\nThere was zero shaming, or guilt tripping.

It's part of the reason he has put me on medications and set me up with nutrition specialists, as well as actually prescribing me a gym membership. I track it, and I track a lot of my medical data just because I'd rather have the data so we can determine the easiest way to get my weight under control.\n\nAnd that came from a conversation where we were really specific about what was happening as I age, and what we could do.\n\nI feel like if you cannot be honest about yourself and your needs to your doc, or you don't feel like you can be straight up with your providers, you can't advocate for yourself.  So it took me some time before I realized I COULD tell my doctor \"I do not agree with that\" and be fine. And worst case? I transfer my GP to someone I work best with.\n\nThat includes if a doctor says something I disagree with, like a time when my spouse and I were in an appointment with our kid's doctor and he said something to the effect that he did not believe migraines were really an issue. To my partner, who has suffered from migraines since she was 10.\n\nOur kid was perhaps five at the time and we just switched doctors for her the next day, because we don't believe in going to a doctor who bases their practice on \"belief\" in the face of decades of medical evidence.\n\nI teach my kid to stand up for herself and to advocate for herself and her needs, and that means living those values as well. And making sure HER doctors know that both her parents are 100% behind her and will support her decisions, and will advocate for her choices*. \n\nAn enormous part of that is making sure I am modeling the kind of behavior I want her to emulate. If she feels uncomfortable with a doctor, or feels like she isn't being heard, I want her to be able to tell the doctor, and us that she doesn't feel like it's a good fit for her medical care.\n\n*This doesn't mean we permit her to skip vaccines or medication that is required for her to be healthy. It means as her parents we advocate for her own body autonomy and encourage her to ask questions about her body, her health, and making sure she is as healthy and functional as she can be without shame or prejudice. We also are open and honest about the effects of drug use - both recreational and medical - and explain what the effects will be.\n\nPoint being, researching your own needs is important, but also finding a doc who takes their job seriously and also is willing to explain the reasons why something is or is not important, and isn't going to dismiss a concern when you bring it up? That's the gold standard."

I’ve been on 30mg 2x daily for three or four years now and it really helps me. I always say that taking my second daily dose makes me feel like my brain just went to the spa! I take my second dose right around 3pm, which is when I start to crash and feel like I literally can’t do anything. When my second dose kicks in, I’m like oh never mind, it turns out I’m actually totally fine. \n\nI have definitely heard that sometimes you can feel sleepy after taking Adderall for the reason you said: your brain actually feels calm! In my completely anecdotal experience, you might need a higher dose and/or to see if you do better on IR or XR. (I don’t remember which one I’m on, but whatever it is, it’s the opposite of the one I was on when I first was prescribed Adderall.)\n\nAlso, as a side note, it’s my understanding that narcoleptics can generally be prescribed up to 60mg of Adderall a day (or more, but then you have to be more careful about heart issues, etc.).

I have really bad anxiety and the shock of the heart rate increase among other factors blew my socks off and scared me to death. Once I kept at it for a while and was able to calm myself, my heart rate went down bc most of the “negative sides” I thought I was having was due to immense anxiety. If you are worried however it is always smart to talk to your psychiatrist/doctor. But starting medication like this is going to be daunting."

    "comment": "OMG, thank you for this; it’s super validating to hear you describe that “clarity without motivation” thing. I just took my first dose of 54mg this morning. A few hours in, I feel a bit more clear-headed, like my thoughts are cleaner around the edges, but nothing majorly different yet. Maybe a slight headache, but otherwise it’s subtle so far. I’m curious to see how it settles over the next few days and whether it provides me with more of the internal activation I’ve been missing.\n\nYour comment about Concerta fixing the inner overthinking but not the couch lock hit is spot on. That’s been exactly my experience. I can see the tasks, the patterns, the emotions, but doing anything still feels hard. I’m also trying to figure out how much of this is meds still calibrating vs. just the process of waking up after years of masking and autopilot.\n\nLet me know how things go for you if you end up switching. Would love to keep sharing notes if you’re up for it. Honestly, just knowing someone else is in this weird in-between space makes it feel a lot less lonely."

Like the fog has lifted, and now I’m left staring at all the things I’ve been avoiding for years. Some days, that clarity feels like progress, and on other days, it’s just overwhelming and disorienting.\n\nI’m still on Concerta, I just took my first 54mg dose today. So far, it feels a bit clearer, but it’s too early to tell how much it’ll help with activation or motivation. Mostly, it still feels like I’m present, but not fully able to act.\n\nI saw you mentioned atomoxetine. I don’t know much about it, but I’m curious. Did you find it helped differently from stimulants, especially around emotional regulation or energy levels? I’ve got C-PTSD in the mix too, so I’m always wondering how these things intersect.\n\nI appreciate you sharing; it makes a huge difference to know that others have gone through this too."

    "comment": "Yes, for me atomoxetine seems to help with the emotional regulation.  I was afraid that the anti-depressant effect would dull my feelings, but my therapist says it just makes a person more like their natural self.  So, say my wife is upset about something I said I'd do and didn't.  Instead of her comments making me go into a shame spiral, I can listen and apologize and start figuring out how to get that task done.  \n\nSo, I can regulate that RSD feeling and focus where I need to.  Now, this is in concert with therapy, so it's tough to know for sure which part is responsible, probably both.  My doctor (separate person from therapist) suggested part of the medication can improve my ADHD/autism while the other part can lift mood... two separate neurotransmitters.  \n\nAs far as energy levels?  It helps me go to sleep earlier in the night, pulls me away from my typical evening hyperfocus activities like video games.  I had a bad sleep two nights ago and man, my ADHD symptoms were bad the next day.\n\nI just read a book about ADHD and Dr Russell Barkley, the author said that we have about a 75% chance of either stimulants or non-stimulants helping.  The advantage of stimulants is that they are easily tested.  If they don't work right away, we know it.  Non-stimulants take longer to take effect, like weeks to months. They also come with different side effects.  Some of the people I've read on here say 1) the side effects were too unpleasant or 2)the medication didn't do much for them"

I don't have too much medical knowledge but if you think it would help you, I would talk with your doctor/specialist about upping the dosage and see how it works.

You have other issues outside of ADHD that might be causing symptoms too (this is super common the first things to go in your body when stressed are focus and executive function)\n3. You need something else on top of your current treatment. \n\nI know you said your counselor brought up your ADHD again, do they specialize in helping to manage ADHD? Are they a sort of academic counselor or is this synonymous with a therapist for you - someone you see routinely to help with your mental health?\n\nMedication is the first thing for adhd treatment but therapy and such can also be immensely helpful. There are some therapists who specialize in therapy for people with adhd, so they have a better idea of how to help manage emotions around having adhd, building systems, etc. \n\nI suggest reaching out to your doctor about how concerta is working for you, and maybe look for a therapist who can help too. If money is an issue, in the US there are private pay therapists which sounds extremely expensive, but many may have sliding scale spots they make space for for some people with financial issues. Your local community mental health clinic might also have some resources."

Concerta is actually doing the opposite at the moment, which is kind of a \"okay, I wanna actually relax, sit down, read a book, chill\" which is unusual for me, but it's at the wrong time as I am navigating unemployment and trying to apply for jobs, write CVs, etc... \n\n  \nSo I am not entirely sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing.
