    "comment": "Damn so many bad experiences. Everyone responds differently to medications, I get it. And I agree, Focalin is hella strong. I was prescribed 10 xr and on the first couple days of using it there were some anxious moments. Fast forward a month and I'm taking 15 xr in the morning and 5 ir in the afternoon. After the first couple days of taking it I experienced hardly any anxious moments. Now it's almost not a problem at all and I am very productive on my current regimen. For your awareness, I had a genetic test done after about a year of failed medications. Supposedly, my body metabolizes amphetamines poorly. This explains my previous issues with taking 20 mg of Adderall XR. Though, I will say: every time I take Focalin  XR or IR I consistently sweat and feel my body temperature rise significantly during the peak. It's nothing I can't deal with, but it's a testament to how ridiculously strong Focalin is. I can recognize why most commenters here can't tolerate it."

That said, it would wear off so fast for me-- within three hours usually. Could be bc I have malabsorption due to wls. \n\nThe med holidays were *hell* on focalin, though. I would be so tired and lethargic. With adderall, the med holidays are much more tolerable. That said, while on-med, I have to put a *lot* more effort into getting motivated to do the shit I need to do.. to the point where I question if adderall even works for me. But, I'm also too set in my routine to fuck with it by changing my meds around. \n\nI'm glad you found something that works really well, OP! :)"

It helps get me going in the morning but that's it. No big difference in focus/concentration, processing speed, etc. It seems to wear off fast too. How soon did you notice a difference?

Took it for about \\~2 years and went cold turkey at the start of high school. Weirdly became less hyperactive and impulsive after that during high school however the attention, vivid imagination, memory, etc still stayed nearly throughout all of high school, was mostly punctual and did long term planning, until I hit my depression during college and caused me to nearly lose it all.

I take one half in the morning & then will take the second half later if I still have things to do. \n\nI switched from adderall to adderall XR to Vyvanse & all of them had me going through crying spells. Vyvanse was the worst for me. I’m talking an hour or two of straight tears at the end of the day for NO REASON. It was insanity. On Focalin I have none of that. The crash is very light & can be managed with a cup of low caffeine tea. \n\nWhat I learned through all of this is that the dosage is extremely important. If you are having dry mouth, your dose is probably too high. Heart racing? Too high. Can’t eat? Too high. That’s one thing to watch for when the dose is being adjusted. It’s better to try taking 1/2 of a non-extended release tablet than the whole thing your first time. Keeps you from getting a crazy tolerance too. On a withdrawal day try some exercise to get yourself out of a funk. After 5 years of cycling through meds I hope this info helps somebody."

My local CVS carries Amneal, which has a better anecdotal record than Par Pharma. I took 10MG today right before I ate, and it definitely disappeared within 3-4 hours.

I did some detailed note-taking, ran errands, and made a lengthy phone call I had been putting off. I was better able to regulate myself away from social media that would bum me out. I went to work, got through a really busy day in retail, came home, and was able to make dinner without my partner's help. \n\nI haven't felt this productive since my first day of Vyvanse, which was my first med when diagnosed in June. Vyvanse was emotionally and cerebrally great, but messed with my resting heart rate and had lots of other side effects. Concerta was next, less side effects at first but then gave me horrible anxiety a couple weeks in. Both made me feel like a total zombie after 5 hours. \n\nConcerta and Focalin both give me mild chest pain. I will ask for follow-up because Focalin seems like it could be the one and I hope it's not a sign of a serious side effect that would disqualify it.\n\nAt the moment, this makes me feel like I did without meds, but crisper, like if I was having a really good day, if that makes sense. I'm hoping it maintains this way for a long while.\n\nI'm also combining meds with therapy and nightly \"meditation\", so all things combined may be starting to have positive impacts.\n\nI hope it holds up well for you, too."

    "comment": "I believe I also had ADHD all my life but was never tested for it. I discovered Meth many years ago and I marveled at how complete I finally felt. I didn’t know at the time but I had been self medicating all along. The downside is that this drug (Meth) is extremely volatile and trouble ensued often. Fast forward: I am now a former Meth addict. I was also prescribed Adderall and Vyvanse, but these 2 did not agree with me, leaving me feeling somewhat disconnected and scattered often. Focalin XR, however, was a miracle discovery for me on every level. Not only did it help tremendously with my ADHD, it also completely brought Meth cravings to a screeching halt as well as crippling the anhedonia I also experienced as a result of the “old” lifestyle. Finally, it felt as if everything were possible, and I went on to do so many, many amazing things feeling strong, confident, and clear. This lasted for 4 years. I began to experience harder “crashes” and my tolerance to Focalin XR was significant. I’ve had no other recourse but to take a break from it. And, it’s actually going really well. My natural inherent physical strength and stamina are coming on-line gradually. Headaches are gone. Vision is clearing right up. I do have moments where I’m a little foggy and out of focus, and it takes a lot of extra effort to stay on task; but overall this break I’m on now is going smoothly.\n\nMy experience with it is that for a few years it afforded me a quality of life I had only dreamed of. It felt like a nice warm coat against a raging blizzard. Not sure when, or if, I’ll need to align with Focalin XR again; just taking it one day at a time. ;)"

My doctor decided to change my medicine to Focalin IR for a dosage change instead of increasing my SC by 3mg. I started it a week ago and I do not like it. The side effects started immediately after the first initial dosage of the medicine. Like within 8-12 hours. I feel very disoriented, sluggish, tired but can’t sleep, disorganized, I am having sensory sensitivity’s. I don’t feel like I’m in reality like it’s triggering a psychosis. My muscles feel like they’re constantly flexed which is causing pain all over. The headaches are annoying and the stomach issues. I have no motivation to get out of bed or do things. It’s nothing like my previous medicine which I was doing fine on just built up a tolerance and it was an issue so I asked for it to go up 3mg. Last time I felt like this psychologically it was caused by having an allergic reaction to gabapentin which lead to me being hospitalized for life threatening conditions.

Focalin IR has similar effects for me, but does cause some mood swings- one moment I feel really happy, the next moment I feel a bit down. I don’t feel this mood lability with Adderall. I have also tried focalin XR. Oddly, I have a very different response to Focalin XR compared to IR. No matter the dose (slightly too low of a dose up to slightly too high of a dose) I feel wayyy too quiet in my mind and body, like I just want to sit and do nothing, with slight improvements in focus on the task but also no energy to talk, and my job involves talking all day so this doesn’t quite work out well.

But if I don’t take an ER early enough I’ll be up all night. \n\nSwitched to Dexedrine which is better than the Vyvanse but still making my stomach cramp up and some mild raynauds.

Concerta makes me feel really calm, (also take 300mg XL Welllbutrin) and without it I started to feel really irritable, cranky and low frustration tolerance.

    "comment": "Focalin is Dexmethylphenidate, which is related to Concerta and Ritalin (Methylphenidate).\n\nFocalin, Concerta, and Ritalin are NOT amphetamine. It has different mechanism of action to adderall. It has some structural similarities in chemical to amphetamines and functions similarly- increasing the concentration of both dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain.\n\nImagine your dopamine and norepinephrine as a pond, with adhd you simply have too little dopamine and norepinephrine aka your pond water level is too low. \nFocalin, Concerta, and Ritalin work to stop the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine. It works to prevent leaks in the pond and prevent loss of water- subsequently increasing the amount of water your have.\nAdderall, Vyvanse, and other amphetamine salts work to increase your production of dopamine and norepinephrine. You will have leaks and loss of water, but there is an additional hose pumping in extra water to compensate and improve your amount of water."

I've never tried Focalin but may. \n\nBased on your analogy, it's no wonder Concerta 'increased' my ability to focus and such because it stopped it from leaving my mind. Whereas Adderall feels like a 'boost' because it has you produce more. \n\nI'd love to see how Focalin works on me with the Concerta shortage and the Authorized Generic no longer being made, my insurance won't cover Concerta sadly."

    "comment": "It’s shocking the difference in brain chemistry. The best reasoning behind why there is such a difference for some people, from my understanding, is how the rest of your body works and what else is impacted. Amphetamines (Vyvanse, Adderall) increases the output of chemicals meaning that it isn’t just your focus that’s affected- it’s EVERYTHING. That means your metabolism has a boost, your energy levels, your focus, everything. That’s why some of the side effects are what they are- sweating (metabolism boost), lack of hunger (kinda in a state of a baby adrenaline rush meaning why would you be hungry if you’re in a rush?), fast talking, tremors and shaking, things like that. \nWith methylphenidate (you block the leaky hole) you don’t produce more but simply have longer to absorb it. Maybe it doesn’t have as much of a kick or it isn’t as potent as some people need, but for me it worked amazing because it DIDNT have those side effects. It certainly didn’t make me as energetic as Adderall or Vyvanse, but the tremors and overheating and other issues were really problematic"

    "comment": "Hello! Let me first start by saying that I don't take this medication/haven't started ADHD meds yet. However, as someone who is in the middle of their medication journey, I have a few comments on your post.\n\n1st: The dosage increase. I can't speak for other medications/medications I haven't taken, but normally when I start on a new medication or have a medication increase, I am always weaned off and or up to the new dose. For one medication this meant one 20mg tablet for 1 week, then adding on a 2nd tablet the next week to meet my maximum dose. For another medication, I weaned off of it for 3 weeks in increments on 5mg every week. The moral of this part is that weaning up and down in doses is from what I know a common practice in mental health/psychiatric medication. Doing a quick internet search produced that focalin needs to be weaned off/have changes made gradually.\nIf you cease taking a medication like this right off the bat, you can experience withdrawal symptoms so be careful of that. \n\n2nd: Those symptoms are a BIG YIKES. Everytime I've ever had a severe symptom to a medication, it was either due to my age (one medication I took months ago gave individuals under 25 risk of Su*c*dal thoughts so that's one example), or due to having too high of a dose (one medication I used to take had 10mg-15mg as my good range/feeling nice. When I went up to 20mg I was a crazy symptoms mess). \n\nI'm glad to hear you aren't going back to that psychiatrist, and I hope you're able to find someone else who prioritizes you and pays more attention/takes more seriously your concerns and questions! Good luck!"

I’ve heard people say Ritalin is a more subtle experience. I would find a different psychiatrist / or even your primary doctor can set you up with something until you find a new psych, and explain the harsh side effects and they should try to find something that works without taking such a toll.

She never should’ve started me on one of the highest dosages. Especially for someone not on any medication. I did have the desired affect and was able to focus and actual do well on school today but at what price because the side effects were debilitating. \n\nPart of me feels as if she got mad I was “telling her what to do” and wanted to prove a point to me by starting me on that high of a dosage because I received the i told you so speech today. But I initially never asked for a higher dose that’s just how she perceived it. The only thing I requested was to change to something better suited for me and from the beginning I told her I had no interest in taking high dosages due to my family history with adhd meds (my father was misdiagnosed and was actually bipolar, he went into psychosis, so I’m careful).

Anyone who is taking a true stimulant is going to develop some level of tolerance, could be a very small amount or very large amount.

Simply just saying how she called you a drug addict and it offended you, lowered your  self esteem, etc. That's not a good look for them. They most likely will put you with another psych who will work with you. If it was me, I'd ask at my next appointment if I could speak to their supervisor. Tell the supervisor or lead administrator of the place, basically everything you've said here. Theyre a mental health facility, and you went, just to be talked bad about basically verbally bullied. They'd give that psych a talking to, or even could  fire them for that. They're flaky-ness with giving you meds, then the shortage, then switching kinds and only getting half... Very unprofessional for a place to do that. Tell them how all these things are negatively effecting many aspects of your life and that before all this you were doing just fine. And I'd personally throw in, if I lose my job or get behind on bills or anything else because of your personal opinions being forced upon me, I know exactly who to blame and come back to with my lawyer. \nOr something of that nature \nSo don't hate yourself for anything.

Took over 6 months to get an appointment for assessment with someone else. Everything was fine the first couple years, but we moved to another state and they required I be tested again. I thought “fine, whatever, it’s not like it magically goes away.”\n\nDoctor then told me I should only take my meds Monday through Friday which was confusing for me because how, then, do I function or do anything on weekends with my partner? It’s not like my needs just magically stop. It took another 6-7 months to get everything transferred to a different doctor. \n\nI thought not taking them on weekends was awful, but I can’t imagine only being supplied 15 pills for a whole month…\n\nThere’s so much research on why stopping is detrimental to our lives. I’ve always been told it’s pretty obvious when people are drug seeking because they’re counting down the days to pick up the next bottle and they run out early etc etc. My pharmacist has told me they’ve never worried about me because I forget almost every month to request a refill on time. Drug addicts are ALWAYS thinking about their next fix - adhd patients are not and are just trying to survive.\n\nI hope you can get a new doctor quickly and that they’re more compassionate (and can read any basic research).

I had been getting a 90-day supply of Adderall 20 mg to take twice a day (morning and afternoon so I could get through work and still have some to get things done at home but could not take it to late that I wouldn't be able to sleep).\n\nThat had been the perfect pace for years. Beginning of this year I started having fatigue issues to the point of narcolepsy-like pass outs but was told I was already on Adderall which is what they'd normally prescribe for it so I went about my business. (Which they have now a year later finally figured out was caused by insulin resistance and high blood sugar that led me into Type 2 Diabetes).\n\nThree months later, I ask for a refill and it happens to be my six month check-up. Now mind you I have GAINED weight on Adderall (which has greatly confused my doctors) and they have been giving me a 90-day supply for years (and some of the time it would take upwards to six months but on average probably 4 months to get through the 90-day shpply because I'd forget to take my afternoon pill) so Substance Abuse has never really been a consideration... but suddenly I had to take a Substance Abuse panel of blood work and urine samples which of course I passed only thing in my system was Adderall. Yet, they'll still only prescribe me a month's dosage.\n\nSo my only conclusion is the government has implemented changed regulations."

I dont have any answers as to why a medication you need daily would not be prescribed daily, do you only have adhd 3 days a week?  Its not something that lasts for more than 1 day.. my problem is mine only last til about 2pm and im fighting to be prescribed a short acting top up to get through the day, because apparently it \"should' last 12-14 hours...so i have an idea of how you feel, when you dont fit into what the text book says you should be. Would we tell a paralysed person they could only use a wheel chair every other day? Obviously not, unfortunaty peoole will say 'but thats differernt'  but its not. The only difference is you can see whats wrong with them and how the wheelchair is necessary, but you cant see our adhd symptoms or why the pills are necessary, so therr fore it must not exsist. Do they not realise we dint actually want tk ha e to take this stuff? Its horid. My heart races, i gave no appetite, i get anxious, i get irritable, i cant sleep-its not fun. BUT imagine how bad my life without them must be if im willing to put up with all that?  I feel you dude, im just sorry i cant help. But hoping a bit of solidarity and an understanding ear might make you feel a bit better. Good luck!"

    "comment": "WTF? I feel like there must be something you're leaving out. The jump in your story from you politely informing her you used to take it daily, to completing a substance abuse program seems like it left out some important bits of information.\n\nAlso though, how long have you been on stimulants? Your story sounds hallmark like someone who is in their first couple years of stimulant treatment, because you claim that they have lost efficacy. I ran into this issue, and my life fell apart completely, but it wasn't the stimulants not working anymore but my tolerance to them. What was the rationale for 15 pills a month instead of 30? is that how much you work in a month?\n\nSometimes you have to make token efforts to satisfy a psychiatrists suspicions, and sometimes they are just terrible psychiatrists. What worked well for me was modafinil, it works longer than 1st line ADHD stimulants did for me in a given workday, and I'm blessed that it felt around the same as vyvanse did at the dosage I'm on. The benefit I've experienced from being on modafinil/armodafinil to treat my ADHD is that as a schedule 4 substance, it aroses a lot less suspicion from both providers and pharmacies. The obvious answer is, find a new psychiatrist, but if you don't have the time or ability to do this, you can try to \"work\" with your psychiatrist, express your SYMPTOMS, if she says the schedule 2 ADHD stimulants are not soemthing shes comfortable with, propose trying modafinil/armodafinil and explain that you read it helps with X Y Z problems with motivation and focus you have.\n\nI sometimes miss vyvanse, but vyvanse was unsustainable for me. I became so reliant on it for the life I created, and taking it everyday, despite what people will say here, will invariably lead to tolerance. Modafinil/armodafinil doesn't have the same tolerance that vyvanse did and I take it daily.\n\nOr follow everyone elses advice theyre going to give you, and get a lawyer/sue her/report her to state board/call the police, all these wild things that require so much effort yet won't help you specifically cope with ADHD life. I find it just wild how these are always the recommendations on this subreddit when it requires exhaustive levels of effort to do things like this, and without benefit, how could people with ADHD possibly motivate themselves to follow through legal processes like this."

Needless to say, I still found a psychiatric NP (this is the kind of provider you want who is totally understanding of what works not stigma).\n\nI always pay out-of-pocket which hurts, but your health is the most important thing. And since you only need to see them maybe once a month, it’s not horrible but I can tell you as a cash paying customer you get the royal treatment from psychiatric nurse practitioners and that means the world when you suffer from ADHD and OCD like me (Vyvanse, Strattera, and Abilify).\n\nFrom my experience, psychiatric nurse practitioners are very well-versed in the latest pharmacological agents and off label use like Abilify for OCD. in the combination of a stimulant and a non-stimulant which other synergistic affect for ADHD."

Over the last 14 years (which is how long it has been since I was brave enough to bring up the dreaded topic with my dr asking about MAYBE needing an antidepressant), I have lost so much faith our medical system, specifically in the realm of mental health. It is a complete joke and a sham that is infuriating when I hear people talk about mental health is such a priority in today’s world. Um no. It is not. I was shocked two years ago as an almost 40 year old when it was suggested that I might benefit from ADHD meds. It was like I could finally live again. But it was short lived as I quickly found out that taking THAT sort of medication gets you treated like a worthless drug addict. My spouse has a lucrative job that we have a good private insurance policy through so I was not expecting to be treated like complete garbage by my Costco pharmacy anytime I picked up my meds. Or, during the worst of the shortage, when I would call and ask if there was any end in sight at getting my rx filled. There are almost no mental health options where I live (and while I’m not in a HUGE city, it’s not tiny) if you are needing care for ADHD such as medication.\n\nNo advice here….. just letting you know that you are definitely not alone in this.

My body did NOT like Strattera and I told her this. She then put me on the highest dose of wellbutrin and I ended up in the ER within a week with horrible side effects. After that, she still said she was not wanting me to try stimulant medication, so I told her I would be seeking care elsewhere. I did not appreciate being put in a dangerous situation just because she had personal feelings against stimulant medication - and the way she talked to me I don't think she even \"believes\" in ADHD. \n\n\n\nYears later - I did a genetic test to see what medications work best for me per recommendation by my current dr - Strattera was on the \"DO NOT take\" list. 🤦 along with a few other SSRI types that drs have suggested/put me on in the past before my ADHD diagnosis.

This doctor’s logic is just bizarre. \n\nAlso, taking a medically indicated dose of Vyvanse once per day as prescribed is by definition not substance abuse. If the doctor disagrees with the previous prescription that’s one thing, but calling it “substance abuse” is just objectively incorrect. \n\nOP, you should review your records with this doctor (if you’re in the US, this is your legal right to do) and insist that substance abuse not be noted in your chart. If the health system resists, escalate to whatever agency regulates medical care in your state. In any complaint, emphasize how the doctor/hospital that is falsely giving you this stigmatizing label is discriminating against your disability by assuming falsely that you must be drug-seeking because of stereotypes about said disability.

Bit the issue there is that some doctors will see every patient as a possible manipulator.\nAnd as soon as you say anything that can be interpretated as \"asking for drugs\" they'll become incredibly stubborn and now they'll see you as a manipulator instead of a patient. Not only is this stereotyping patients, they judge you and since alot of doctors have the arrogance of middle age kings,  you will have a hard time finding an actually intelligent individual who is capable of critical thinking and doesnt put a label on patients until after the patient has shown their labels.\nIf a doctor is like that you're better of finding a new one, since not only is it very tiresome to have to explain what you say at every turn so she won't jump to conclusions, it also shows unprofessionalism. Of from day one the doctor questions everything you say as a lie you will never receive the proper care from that doctor. They didn't become a doctor because they feel with people, but because of the pay and status that comes with such a job. And depending on where you live, they're also incentivized to write als little prescription as possible by the insurers. Where I life for example to steer ppl away from the best, also expensive, adhd meds, they ask you to pay 200 upfront, which you can get back if you're willing to jump thru hopes and the patients to deal with weeks of bureaucracy, which alot of patient simply can't do because of their finances or mental issues. That whole 200 is unnecessary, even since you get it all back, it's merely there to scare ppl away from the most expensive meds. They'd rather have you have side effects, adverse affects on health then spend a little more money. They don't care for your health but your wallet. And I don't know if ur in USA for example because over there the system is insane beyond comprehension and I honestly advice ppl with medical needs to leave the usa and go to Europe or something, nowhere is it perfect,  but some countries have really high standards  in how they should treat their patients. \nWhatever the case may be, i hope youll be able to find another doctor who is less judgemental and who actually listens to you not just follow their system like some Droid. \nI know the benefits from adhd as I myself suffer it aswell and if they took my meds away, or even halfed it, I would be put on course to failure, just a question of how long I can uphold it but at some point it'll all come crashing down and become psychotic. But I do take more then just adhd meds so it would be different but still I know it can be very scary even felling like reality itself is unsettled. \nLike those meds allowed you to run and keep up with the others, and nowbthey want you to slow down again and restart falling behind.\nLook for reviews of a new doctor before you make a decisions. Also you might want to stay away from some doctors over the age of 35-40.\nThere is a clear difference between what they used to teach about mental health and what they teach these days. They are required to stay with the changes, but I think most will just stick with what was taught them in school. And skepticism was alot higher then towards mental issues. I'm not saying there aren't good doctors above that age, but there is definitely a trend there. Back then a doctor was like a Rockstar type status so think about which ppl will do such a job.\nNow my therapist, is looked down on by his in-laws for what he does, the instance he works for isn't a private thing, so it doesn't pay very much, it's a okay living but if you were in it for the money you wouldn't start there. So I feel like why they do that job is because their heart is in its not their wallets. Which is a indication of how well their care will be.\nNumerous time that older doctors have done a poor job, sending someone home with a bleeding ulcer at age of 16 for example, because no matter what you say he know better and you \" probably ate something bad\". Have you wait days for your appointment, then have you wait an hour beyond your actuall appointment in the waiting room, for them to not listen to what you say, talk over you, and have you on your way on 10 minutes,  preferably even less so, but they charge you insane amount for that \"visit\". \nHonestly if its anything like that just run. you're nothing but income and they don't care about your actually wellbeing, you'll be dismissed, misdiagnosed, made to feel like a junky for asking them the proper care. When it's your health and live you want someone who cares as much about your health as you do."

I ended up going to a Psychiatrist that's a bit farther away that I heard good things about and she listened to me and even ran me through the diagnosis process again. If you can do that I would recommend it. This person sounds stubborn and isn't worth the effort to convince."

It was my first time with a psychiatrist as my doctor in my old state had always willingly just gave me a prescription and helped me find one that worked for me (Vyvanse). This doctor, Dr. Crow made me feel so terrible she legit made me cry and I straight panicked and pushed my sleeves up and said “look no track marks I’m just trying to feel normal” or something to that effect. I had never felt so humiliated, she made me l made me feel like I was drug seeking for something that literally keeps me employed. I hated her, she gave me my prescription but I was a fucking mess. I was a 30 year old male crying like a child in this persons office. Fuck your psychiatrist, I hope you get what you need. Nobody I’ve talked with who has medication for ADHD really wants the meds, but we want to feel “normal” and not stand out. She is a disgrace."

My psychiatrist said she wants me to have the assessment and an EKG before we begin stimulants. \nShe never mentioned my addiction history because it's irrelevant. I actually AM a drug addict (in recovery), and she didn't say anything about that. \nI do have a long history of clean drug tests and was on Suboxone for almost 4 years (off it now). But I guarantee she wouldn't have said anything if that weren't all true. Because she's a professional who also has a heart and common sense."

She is irresponsible to treat you like an addict. People wearing glasses isn't helped if they are allowed to wear it every 2 days. Or imagine someone with a pacemaker where the doctor turns it off per remote every 2 days. How would that go?\n\nFind a new doctor. Mine is very different. He is very understanding. He knows my background and has a lot of trust that I have a good feel for my body and what he needs. So he let me even find my own pace with the dosages and I reported back to him frequently the changes. Things like how well my body receives it and if my symptoms have improved. I am on MPH which has the good advantage that it gives quick results and doesn't need a long build up time. So I started with 5mg in the morning. But quickly noticed it's too low. Went to 10 and then 20. I tried even 40 and 60 just to see if my focus improves. But past 20 I don't feel any additional benefits. So I sticked with 20 at a time.\n\nI am using the meds when I need to work. On weekends when I know I have nothing on the plate or little I just don't take any. But I have to make sure not to accumulate more than 2 days without. Otherwise my chronic fatigue comes back swinging and destroys me."

There’s no such thing as an across the board consistent result. There’s always not only people who react differently but people who react the OPPOSITE as they should- like the listed possible side effect of anti depressants causing suicidal thoughts. \n\nSo to ignore your patient explaining how medication is working or not working for them is absolutely irresponsible and a terrible medical practice. \n\nAnd all that aside, 15 pills for 30 days? I’ve never heard of ANY doctor suggesting that. Like that’s not a short break to avoid tolerance. Thats more like recreational use.

Welbutrin made me not feel my vape, which is probably my most effective ADHD treatment. Chose vaping over welbutrin. Qelbree was actually working very well, but the medication is so frustratingly time sensitive. 12pm dose, 12:15pm agonizing headache if late. I overslept one day and had the only migraine I've ever had in my life. I thought I was dying for a good 36 hours.\n\nSo I decided I don't need any medication. I'll just live with ADHD.\n\nNow I am in a much more technical role and would absolutely benefit from medicating again with a stim. I know because I was prescribed it in the past. And they worked.

Perhaps we’re describing the same thing with different words. \n\nFiguring out the right dosage for your particular needs should be an evolving conversation with your doctor. It can take months of measured adjustment to dial in the proper dose that you need so please resist the urge to “keep quiet” and instead be open about it with them.\n\nFor all the horror stories that appear on Reddit about doctors who aren’t flexible or are misguided, there are likely a vastly larger number of positive interactions people with ADHD have with their own doctors that aren’t being reported."

    "comment": "From my experience some medical professionals can be incredibly self-righteous and stuck in their own belief systems. And due to the underworld of buying/selling stimulant meds they can be extremely skeptical/accusatory in the beginning I’d assume especially if this is through the public system.\n\nIf they are leading with preconceived beliefs, the slightest thing could ‘confirm’ their initial assumptions and not much will change their mind. \n\nThat being said, were you speaking/acting in a way that may have been conveyed as being irrational/abnormal? (For example, overtly emotional, frantic, pleading, loud, frustrated, or anything of that sort?)\n\nNot asking to point blame just for context. Also, did you bring all documents from your previous psychiatrist? \n\nRegardless, some helpful advice I received and from my own experiences: \n1. Always act in a calm, collected and professional manner.\n2. Never specifically ask for medication, rather explain your symptoms and past medical advice (eg. ‘my previous psychiatrist recommended xxx’), and let them think it is their idea. \n3. Don’t speak in a way that makes them feel challenged or that you know more than them.\n4. Play dumb, let them feel in control and knowledgeable. Repeat questions, ask for clarification, etc.\n5. Always use medical terminology. Don’t refer to medication by its ‘street name’ / ‘shortened version’. Also refrain from using words like ‘pills’ ‘meds’ etc.\n\n- - - \n\nPersonally I’d lodge a formal complaint if I were accused of something like this. I’d put it in writing, use emotion-provoking language rather than emotional language. Mention your concern for future patients being accused in this manner, and the ‘unprofessionalism’. You can contact your previous psychiatrist’s office and ask for all of your medical documentation to accompany the complaint. Then request a formal review. \n\nHope something here helped :)"

My Psych is the best I’ve found in 30years, and after time they suggested we move to Adderall. \n\nI was concerned with taking a stimulant after reading all the horror stories out there about addiction etc. I expressed those concerns, they thoroughly and knowledgeably answered my questions and put to rest my fears of “being an addict.” \n\nSomehow with Adderall I can fall asleep on it now too, but less often. The confirmation of my ADHD was when I was not hyper on it and instead calm and more focused. I forget to take it sometimes, and realize it hours later when frustrated that I am not able to stay in any task or (funny enough) feel very hyper. \nIf I don’t take it I don’t get withdrawal symptoms, but I certainly don’t function well get much of anything good accomplished either.

I took Vyvanse when the shortages were really bad, and unfortunately, the sticker price of name brand Vyvanse kept enough in stock for me (I specifically got my insurance policy because it covered Vyvanse). I started to lose trust in her when she took the switch to lower my dose of Vyvanse to 30 mg. I agreed with her initial argument of, it’s a different drug. You may have a different reaction. But she refused to go past 40 mg, switching to the unscientific argument of, “well, you took 2 20s. 20 x 2 is 40. Therefore 40 mg of Vyvanse = 2 x 20 mg of Adderall IR.

Yes, addiction, but I never abused stimulants and likely never will- I don’t enjoy them and have intense health anxiety that blood pressure/racing heart would 100% activate.\n\nI trusted the recovery group with many urging me to put substance abuse on my record. They often encourage it even as a preventative measure although I did so to access a specific therapy provider and was worried about someday suffering pain and being denied medication. \n\nIt wasn’t much of an issue for a long time, but I only see a few providers. I had to look for a new doctor after changing insurance and then it finally came back to bite me. The new GP was entirely rude and prejudiced toward me and of course refused to prescribe my regular stimulant med at a modest dosage.\n\nNew doctor was not from the progressive area I live in, but Texas. I doubt red states have much professional education about removing bias from their treatment of patients. So although in my experience it hasn’t been entirely detrimental to have it on my record, I imagine in some areas it would be a very bad mark. \n\nI then got a great new doctor who is basically opposite. To my surprise he suggested removing the note from my history due to it being 6+ years ago. I hadn’t realized they could just go in and do that. And I’m sure it’s still somewhere in my record but not anywhere a doctor is going to actually see.

Vyvanse dosage is artificially inflated because it is cut with lysine so that it cannot be snorted for a high. It has to go through the blood stream, lysine gets ate up (scientific term) and then the drug works. So the max dose of Vyvanse is 70mg, higher than adderall, and prescription doses can be expected to be higher although titrating up is to be expected to.  What a shit doctor"

You are entitled to damages, actual, (for example, it cost you your job so lost wages) and also emotional/pain and suffering caused. \n\nThe doctor will, of course, have a defense for their doing this; however, the standard of care is based on what a ‘reasonable’ person would do and 80% (per NIH site), of doctors prescribe stimulants first.

Adderall isn’t an extended-release medicine but Vyvanse is. If you’re taking 30 mg of Vyvanse, you need to divide it in 12 hours, because those capsules are coated against stomach acids, so they don‘t desolve as quickly as Adderall does. You’re getting 2,5 hours of effect then."

Also, I hear migraine conditions can be confusingly similar, with auras etc. So that's terrifying for us all! \n\nAfter seeing my GP again after that seizure, getting a bunch of scans done, again had to wait several months to see a neuro -- & finally got bumped up the list because I had a new job riding on it, being cleared as safe to work. The neuro was great, tho, & finally explained things to me properly after years of not understanding shit about this condition, & she put me on medication that is both safe during pregnancy (I'm at that age) *and* doesn't make my hair fall out! (Of course, seeing this specialist at the hospital meant that I caught the most horrific flu of my life, & viral infections have also brought on seizures for me in the past, so it was like ... dangerous to see the specialist! But I was ok.)\n\nAnyway, sorry for rambling. Migraines are fucked! It's almost like these doctors just think it's a bad headache or some shit. Even as a non-doctor with Google & a partner who endures them, I can see that it's way more than that! And it's scary, because it could be an indicator of so many other things.

I don’t think it would really interfere with medication, since a lot of people smoke and it’s not really a big deal (not great health wise in general, but not interacting w the drug enough for negatives)\n\nSome adhd medication, depending on the person, may also increase or decrease their desire to consume nicotine- which can make it either harder or easier to quit if desired. For me, I vape more when I’m on my medications honestly. \n\nLeaf is also not going to really interfere with the medications, it’s more so a personal choice whether or not to do it. It’s also far less addicting than nicotine. She’s an adult and can make her own decisions about it, and if it’s not interfering with anything then I wouldn’t worry much."

Why she chose a strict school knowing she was doing this is another question but she can’t seek help there. So the vaping alone is addictive along with the leaf vaping.

Statistically speaking folks with adhd are more likely to be college drop outs (i was). As far as the leaf, it helps some with adhd for some people. My meds help with a lot of my symptoms, but sometimes the leaf helps me slow my thoughts, or feel less overwhelmed to help me push through stressful periods. \n\nAt the end of the day, if you are still in contact and have a good relationship, I'd recommend just keeping tabs and checking in every now and then asking if there is anything you can help with. It's up to her to seek out help *assuming she needs it*. You can also reach out to the other school to let her advisor know. Just because it's a Christian school doesn't mean there aren't understanding staff there with more... accepting views, that can help her *again if she needs it*"

In any case now she can pay her own  tuition and make her own choices. She does have a psychiatrist for adhd meds so she can ask for help. I can’t say this helped our relationship since she knows my position on addictive behaviors and she cannot live in my home doing this but these are her choices.

As a mother, your support, understanding, and patience. If your fear is her being expelled, then you should have a conversation with her, she very well may not be doing anything against college rules. \n\nSounds like you need to do some research on adhd, as well as become more connected with your daughter.

Lisdexamphetamine turns into dexamphetamine in your body after you take it.\n\nTaking the version that has to convert in your body makes it last longer, it's still becomes the same active ingredient and does the same things.

It is now for sleeping and resting ONLY.  \n  \nWhatever changes you need to make to your charging habits, sleep/wake accoutrements like alarms and other aids, and room layout should be considered priorities. Make this change one that's supported by several others. Embed it deep into your life so breaking the rule feels alien and wrong.  \n  \nI wear a smart watch to bed for the sleep tracking and, more importantly, alarm functionality. I can rely less on my phone for that now. I also moved the wireless charger for my phone to my desk. Before I received the watch I used a Hatch Restore to wake up with light, and also set some smart lights in my room to turn on with my alarm, so I'd have a ramp up alarm with the Hatch and a \"wake up now\" light to signal that I should be out of bed already.  \n  \nCurrently, the watch and Hatch work together. I use the Hatch to play noise on a sleep schedule, and wake with both as alarms. I'm sure there are worthy competitors to the Hatch so I don't want to ride for an Amazon product- I was gifted this and don't know what to call the generic name for this device (sunrise alarm?).  \n  \nLong story long, because I no longer bring my phone to bed, I no longer have access to my phone without first getting out of bed.

So when I'm planning my life a bit and I identify a longstanding problem like lying in bed forever, I have to find a way to remind my lying-in-bed self that the best, smartest version of me already decided I should get up. I use visual reminders to force bed-me to remember this, like a note on the ceiling.\nIt almost feels like deciding to leave bed is a cost-benefit analysis, looking at the next minute of my life, and the first minute out of bed is never as good as staying in bed. Then I wait for the guilt and boredom to build up until the ongoing pain outweighs that first cold minute. So the way to avoid this is to believe that my present self is just...bad...at deciding when to change tasks, which means the prospect of suffering while getting out of bed is not something I should base my actions on."

When i said no, they would say why not, you are not doing anything, I told them I am I am watching TV. \n\nFirst, saying \"why\" after I said no is a manipulation, Americans are fat and lazy and it's because we are couch potato so he have to act like that is not me. but a day off is a day off-days on are crazy on- it's a job to go to bed on time, to get up on time, getting up on time is a chore, getting out the door on time is a job, leaving the house on time with everything you need is a chore, work, being productive, meeting deadlines, getting back from lunch on time, cause I left my lunch at home, straightening up my desk before I have to go, making my train, remembering to stop at the store, cause there is nothing in the fridge, making sure what I plan to ware the next day is clean and pressed and it starts all over again, but i can't sleep because I am worried about missing what I missed today, tomorrow.

    "comment": "I've been there. Still go there sometimes. I can understand the feeling. The best way for me is to find some routine (easy going for me is the way in the mornings because I'm not a morning person). Coffee, relaxing music, journaling, maybe reading something motivational. Then I always have 3 top things I want to hit for the day. (I can always defer to a list and pick something easy and important rather than overwhelming myself with the whole dump list). \n\n\nSometimes there are still certain moods that come where there is no motivation. I give myself grace then, but I do have to have limiters on my phone to keep me from staying there all day (because I dread the after-feeling too). \n\n\nKnowing what actually makes you feel like doing something is key (knowing your drained times of the day vs when you actually have energy). Often when I'm doom scrolling it's because I'm burned out (work or social). Then it's an inevitable thing (I'm gonna scroll, but try to keep my limiters on, I'll choose a movie that is inspiring and motivates me to want to get up after and do something). I used to spend all day in bed easy (but got so behind on life and felt crappy about myself, I knew I was capable of more...took a solid year to figure out the tricks and my own triggers and motivators). Meant to add that if you can find what causes burnout -if that's the case and what drives you to doom scroll -that's a big piece to the puzzle. I noticed that I don't do it nearly as often if I'm better balanced in life between downtime and work. Fun and a couple light easy hobbies helps me. Self-care (a tough one) helps me too. \n\n\nI find success with the other commenter's mention of 5 mins. The pomodoro effect works. Set a timer (pick a small easy task for 5-15 mins). Before you know it you'll be moving right along. Music helps, but I often get too set in my tunnel vision brain that I forget about turning it on, but when I do put it on it's a game changer. Dancing putting the dishes away. That's golden. \n\n\nADHD is difficult and different for so many. \nKnowing what moves you (and when you're most likely to move and why is really helpful).\n\n\nThe more you can get away from your screens (for longer periods of time) the easier it gets to stay away from them (because the change feels amazing). It's a black hole as we know. If you can (or don't already) find other replacement activities for doom scrolling. I find getting outside helps for quick walks or writing a letter, calling a friend, art, a good book (anything that gets me off the screen is a benefit and a start on the opposite direction than I'm going in the moment. \n\n\nGood luck 💛⭐"

Something I’ve started doing that does kinda help (if executed perfectly) is take my meds while I’m still in bed and set my alarm for like an hour. Meds have kicked in by then and I just get up and start doing shit. Try not to sit down, don’t touch my phone, make a to do list that I definitely won’t use but it at least puts me in “get shit done” mode. Sometimes I fail tho and I pick up my phone while I’m drinking my coffee and boom suddenly it’s 6 hours later 🥲"

    "comment": "Hi! I’ve never been prescribed Focalin, but I have been prescribed Adderall, Vyvanse and Ritalin. Something I’ve found to be universal across all three is that the generic manufactured versions all work differently. It’s important to note that these meds are only required to have a 85%-125% bioequivalence to the brand name, which could cause them to be less effective. It is tedious, but after trial and error I’ve come to the conclusion that I need to call pharmacies prior and ask what manufacturers they have, then calling my psychiatrist to say which pharmacy to send the meds to. A lot of people here on reddit have spoken about generic manufacturers that work for them, so that’s definitely worth taking a look at! If possible brand name medication is always the best option, but unfortunately with generics available, insurance is so much less likely to approve them. I wish you luck"

    "comment": "Hi, yes! It could very well be a year til the meds are back in stock. Pharmacies aren’t told when they’re getting them in stock. It’s all their supplier companies saying “TBD” on when they might get them in. Manufacturers of these medications simply aren’t able to produce fast enough to meet demand. I’m fairly certain it’s due to supply chain issues with materials needed to make these meds. Be nice to your pharmacies and check Costco, Sam’s club, Walmart in suburban areas/ areas with higher concentration of older people. Be nice and polite on the phone and ask if the medication is available and let them know in what quantity/ strength/ if your insurance covers brand or generic. Be nice to the techs and pharmacists, they deal with this everyday and letting them know you appreciate them might go a long way. If your doctor allows you could also get partial fills of the prescriptions. Like if a pharmacy has say 23 pills instead of the full 30 you’re needing, you could get that and have the doctor write for the remainder and pick that up elsewhere. In the end, If no one’s got it no one’s got it and I can tell you everyone is annoyed and angry at the situation, you’re not alone. Also a written out physical prescription(if acceptable in your state) would be a great way of saving the phone calls to the doctor trying to get the prescription sent elsewhere when one pharmacy doesn’t have it."

The first month my doc suggested I get an adderall generic to substitute. Well I got Actavis 20mg XR and it was absolute trash. I would have rather drank 20 energy drinks a day, it made me feel horrible. So this past month, I had to put up $356 for Vyvanse as it is non preferred in the eyes on my health insurance company. But it was either that or Actavis (That is the only generic adderall I could find at pharmacies the last two months). So to me it was worth the extra $300 and luckily I had enough in my HSA account that covers it until I can try to figure something else out for next month. At least the Vyvanse actually helps. I am not sure what to do... does anyone have a suggestion on readily available adhd medication that actually works and is cheaper?"

I had to call 5 pharmacies and each time they had it in stock when I had my doctor send the prescription they said that they had already filled someone else's script and didn't have the quantity I needed. \n\nI'm thinking about asking to switch to Azstarys or something newer, even though it will be costlier. I'm assuming there's not a shortage for those."

The methylphenidate helped a little bit in school but not much and it never dealt with the emotional side. Focalin is like having a completely different kid.  We stockpiled it over the summer. I never had a problem getting name brand, but his new insurance will only cover generic and I can't get it anywhere. Supposedly they will approve it with a pre-authorization but the doctor is having to jump through hoops at this point to say the generic doesn't work, which isn't true but I can't get it otherwise."

I thought Focalin was pretty close to Adderall, but I may be wrong. My girls are fraternal twins. Her sister is a straight A student. She has no issues academically, but definitely has issues socially. She has a very hard time making & keeping friends. So, I think she does have ADHD, but she has not been diagnosed.

If I make the better choice, I'll get a reward that makes me feel better, and if I make a choice not to, I simply don't get  the reward and it also might result in a negative consequences for me. I think if I can look at it as basically a simple either/or choice with the knowledge of the probable consequences from each choice, but let go of the guilt it could be empowering. Because for me the guilt often takes me down a rabbit hole of self loathing about ALL my so called bad choices and that is never productive.  \n\nI found a Buddhist proverb that I think goes well with this approach.\n\n\"Every morning we are born again.

So you can tell yourself “I’m going to go do the dishes now” or “I’m going to watch TikTok videos for 2 hours”, and either way, it’s a conscious, active choice.\n\nThe next morning, instead of feeling guilty about not having the willpower to do what you knew was best, you might feel better knowing you just made a choice and stuck with it. I guess the idea is to foster a feeling of control over your behaviour rather than just allowing yourself to unconsciously bounce off the guard rails over and over.\n\nI think that’s the gist of it."

When you realize you’re about to doom scroll (or whatever), think to yourself “I shouldn’t put off going to bed. But I want to. I’m choosing to: procrastinate/go to bed.” \n\n\nThe next day, instead of beating yourself up for your lack of self control, accept that you consciously made that choice. You’re not tired bc you’re a bad person, you’re tired bc you wanted to play on your phone so you did. And that’s ok! \n\n\nStop assigning morality to those choices and start accepting that making a less than ideal choice doesn’t make you a bad person.  Plus, once you take the guilt and shame out of it, it gets easier to acknowledge that you are in control and it gets easier to make the more responsible choice next time."

    "comment": "What OP is describing is called mindfulness. It's a proven technique for helping to quit bad habits.\n\n\nMost bad habits have their roots in positive/negative reinforcement and our stress response. Basically, when we're confronted with something unpleasant or unsatisfying, we will avoid that thing (*stress response*). The bad habit is formed when we try to eliminate the negative feelings associated with it by doing something that makes us feel good (*positive/negative reinforcement*). Next time we get confronted with a stressor, we seek out that reward.\nBAM! Bad habit.\n\n\nMindfulness combats this. When you find yourself doing the behavior you want to stop, ask yourself what you're doing and why. Ask why you're avoiding a task. What will the negative consequences be? And the positives? You will begin to relate the behavior to the negative aspects (like lack of sleep or missed deadlines, etc.), and the desired behavior to a reward (well rested, more free time on weekends, etc.)making you less likely to do it again.\n\n\nAll that said, we will struggle with this more than non-ADHD people. Techniques like this paired with medication are the best route."

    "comment": "I agree with the many recommending Focalin for the time being. It's dexmethylphenidate as well. The serdexmethylphenidate in the Azstarys is just the prodrug of dexmethylphenidate. \n\nA prodrug is just a compound that your own body turns into the drug required. Vyvanse is also a prodrug, but is amphetamine, whereas Azstarys is methylphenidate. The whole point of a prodrug is to make it more effective. In the case of methylphenidate, a lot gets wasted when taken orally, so the prodrug makes it so you get more out of it. \n\nYou will probably have to fool around with the dose and expect to need a higher dose of Focalin vs what your Azstarys dose is. It won't feel exactly the same, but it'll be damn close, enough to tide you over till you can get Azstarys again."

    "comment": "not sure if someone else said this yet but it looks like Azstarys is a formulation of serdexmethylphenidate and dexmethylphenidate. the serdexmethylphenidate is a prodrug of dexmethylphenidate so it enters your system later than the immediate release dexmethylphenidate. this is pretty much exactly the same as focalin xr or the generic dexmethylphenidate er! it might even work better for you because the serdexmethylphenidate has a really low bioavailability thus needing a high dose but i take focalin and the capsules are biphasic release which have 50% ir and 50% er so if you’re on the Azstarys middle dose with 7.8 mg dex ir that is nearly equivalent to dexmethylphenidate er 15 mg. same thing for the 10.4 Azstarys to 20 mg dexmethylphenidate er. the price ends up being something between $40-80 each month depending on how grateful my insurance is feeling but it’s much better than 500😅 if it ends up being really expensive you could even do 10 mg ir 2x a day; i take an ir dose in the afternoon and the ir prescription is soo much cheaper it’s like 14 dollars usually."

Doctors are usually empathetic in this regard because they know full well how messed up the Healthcare system is in the mental health space. \n\nI assume you're in the US where Healthcare and Medicines are a massive insurance racket. \n\nOften you can find other countries that produce medications with the same active ingredient very cheaply.\n\n\nEdit1: the active ingredients are dexmethylphenidate, a CNS stimulant, and serdexmethylphenidate. I'll do some research.\n\nEdit2: seems your tablets have a fixed molar ratio of 30% dexmethylphenidate and 70% serdexmethylphenidate.\n\nEdit3:  Dexmethylphenidate, sold under the brand name Focalin. \n\nEdit4: serdexmethylphenidate is a very new chemical and currently there are no *legal* alternatives for sourcing it unfortunately.\n\n\nEdit5: it would probably be against the rules to mention that India doesn't give a flying fuck about patented medicine and produces medicine as cheap as possible for its citizens. I am not suggesting you set up Google alerts for Indian pharmaceutical companies producing this chemical."

Why \\*would\\* it work?  If you instead did 10 IR morning and afternoon and it didn't work you'd ask to up the dose.  Remind your prescriber to look at the actual pharmacokinetics and features of the drug before prescribing.  This is a huge pet peeve of mine."

If you have any other significant medical costs, you will meet likely your deductible either way. If you can afford the $500 cashflow for a few months, it likely makes great financial sense to pay down your deductible, not to put it off.

I would also research what the cost of your medical appointments are after you made the deductible.\n\nI had a similar situation one year and I just paid the ridiculous $500 a month for 3 months and in my case the out-of-pocket was the same as the deductible so everything else was free for the rest of the year.\n\n\nI hope this makes sense.  Basically paying more money up front to satisfy the deductible earlier to pay less later."

    "comment": "I'm still learning myself, but as my psychiatrist explained to me: each medication responds to dopamine receptors differently. There are multiple kinds of dopamine receptors, [(linking a health study about it that can explain better than I can)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538242/#:~:text=There%20are%20five%20types%20of,regulation%20of%20renal%20function%2C%20locomotion), and each med treats each receptors differently. What's more, generic can sometimes respond differently than labeled drugs because our brains are sensitive to every slight adjustment of meds, and generics are made with different manufacturers.\n\nADHD is a spectrum, as we know - inattentive, hyperactive, and varying kinds of combinations. Apparently, it gets more nuanced than this due to WHAT dopamine we're lacking, as folks with ADHD. I've previously been on Strattera, which is supposed to be a low-anxiety ADHD med, but it affected (my psychiatrist's theory) the wrong receptors, making me MORE agitated. I was still too low of the brain chemicals I needed and had too much of a receptor that didn't need the help.\n\nAzstarys is a newish ADHD med that's supposed to be like a mix between Adderall XR and Vyvanse! It contains serdexmethylphenidate (an extended-release stimulant) and dexmethylphenidate (an immediate-release stimulant) to help keep you active for longer. More info [(here)](https://www.goodrx.com/azstarys/what-is). Since you take both meds, it might be worth inquiring about this one!\n\nAccording to my psychiatrist, because this is a labeled med, it's more consistent. Apparently, generic meds are known to fluctuate between working and not working due to slight changes between each refill. Because it's consistent, she told me it will work more regularly.\n\nI've only been on Azstarys a short while, but it's helped me way more than Concerta (my last med), Strattera, etc. Concerta didn't help me exactly in the way I needed it, and apparently, it's by default generic, so it fluctuates efficiency anyway, and Strattera just wasn't a good fit for me. She said Vyvanse would likely work for me, but Azstarys has the benefits of extended release where Vyvanse doesn't. Sure enough, my meds have been working all the way into the evening! It gets less effective around dinner time, but I'm still able to do stuff until I fall asleep. My biggest issue right now is that it's giving me insomnia.\n\nI hope this answers your question and helps! Also, if someone knows more than me , I'm not a psychiatrist or at all knowledgeable about this stuff. I just talked about it in depth with my psychiatrist last month and found it interesting enough to retain information and do some research myself."

My health insurance (BCBS) tried like the dickens to get me on generic Vyvanse (too many inconsistencies and side effects, same with generic Adderall years back) and my Dr had to request the name brand medication specifically. After jumping through hoops and getting a pre-auth, my insurance was finally willing to cover it at 25.00 per refill. Before all of that, I was paying 85.00 a month.\n\nEven if it were still 85.00..

This med contains some of the short acting methylphenidate and some that is processed in a similar way to vyvanse in that it is converted over time by your body into methylphenidate.

Also vyvanse is an extended release by definition over as much as 12 hours so suggesting that is not an extended release is silly.

After that I don’t pay anything, no co pays, no medication costs, nothing.\n\nYou should do the math and see if you can do it every year and maybe once you’d have to pay a higher cost but reach the deductible.

Right now I get prescribed 60mg a day which I believe is the FDA recommended max dose. I would like to slowly try some other things so I can hopefully rebuild my zenzedi tolerance. I’m currently trying generic strattera but honestly don’t think it’s doing anything lol. If I asked my doc to try Azstarys, does that count as a separate max dose? Or would it count towards my zenzedi max dose? I would love to try like Azstarys in the morning (I work 12+ hr shifts) and zenzedi as boosters if needed depending how long the azstarys worked. But I don’t want to risk it not working and then not have enough zenzedi to cover me for the month. Any suggestions?"

    "comment": "Yeah, it's semi common for people to react to one class this way I think. \n\nHowever, not all drugs within each class (methylphenidate family vs amphetamine) are the same by any means. Personally, Concerta makes me really sleepy but Focalin is fine. And Adderall also does it to me (although it seems to be dose specific - too little makes me sleepy, just right is fine but too finicky to achieve, and too much makes me REALLY sleepy) but Vyvanse is fine. \n\nIf it persists I'd just let your doc know you're experiencing this side effect and ask to try something different. If you haven't tried Vyvanse yet that might be worth a go, but ime even the different release formulations of methylphenidate are different enough to be worth a try."

As someone who took prescribed focalin for several years, here's what I can tell you. \n\nAs far as stimulant effects go, it's very effective. Productivity was great and really helped me get shit done and stay on task. \n\nHowever, from my experience, these benefits were FAR outweighed by the negative side effects: \n\n-Heightened anxiety, especially around people\n-Mild irritability \n-Emotional numbness (feeling like a zombie)\n-Dissociation\n\nThis was from a 10mg IR dose, which is relatively low for my weight. \n\nYou might not even experience these negative effects. I've had colleagues who have had great success with this med. \n\nWhat I can say is, if you experience any of these symptoms, start with a lower dose or try a different med altogether. People generally have better luck with Adderall or Vyvanse. \n\nWish you luck and hope this helps."
