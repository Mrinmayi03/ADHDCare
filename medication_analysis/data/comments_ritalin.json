The initial euphoria you can experience can be very pleasant but misrepresentative of how you‚Äôll feel once your body adjusts to the medication. With that said, most people still notice a huge difference in symptom reduction in symptoms from ADHD, so that‚Äôs good. My first three days on Adderall I was able to see how disorganized and messy I had been living and was able to clean and organize everything to a very functional space. I still maintain it to this day and am able to do much more thanks to it."

The biggest revelation I had the first time I took my medication was that I could actually listen to people when they were talking to me.\n \n\nNormally I'd be hearing a part of a song looping in the background of my mind all day, or be thinking about what I should say when the other person is done talking. Sometimes even thinking about something else completely different from the conversation. \n\nAfter my first dose the music stopped, and I was able to actually focus on what the person I was engaging with was saying. It was amazing, I had no idea that was a normal thing for others.\n\nDamn near made me cry from joy and loss at the same time."

I had been in a rut, basically just wallowing in a stagnant pool of no progress, no motivation, and no direction in life.\n\nAfter I became medicated again as an adult, I just felt like doing things again. And it wasn't torture.\n\nBut the biggest difference was long-term planning/life management. Setting a long-term goal and working at it a little every day until it is accomplished is an absolutely ESSENTIAL life skill, and without medication I don't have it. With medication, I feel human."

No struggle, no putting it off, no stopping halfway. I finished and just looked at it and wondered \"how was that so EASY???\". I had literally not cleaned it in 5+ months, but that day I did it and it took literally no effort. Since then it's stayed clean, because when I see a dirty dish or something on the floor I pick it up and put it away. Seems ridiculous but I never realised what a struggle life was until I started taking my meds. The mental block in my mind was suddenly lifted."

Got diagnosed, prescribed Ritalin, took it and got into a University I would never have dreamed of.\n\nI used it for a while, changed to concerta then medikinet. But now, It works but It just feels unpleasant. I feel the energy and need to accomplish something, I feel the same clearness when I first started using meds but I still couldn't got up to do the simplest of jobs even with meds. When I used meds It just made it worse because I wanted to do and needed to do lots of things and for a reason I couldn't.\n\nNow I don't use meds and I feel better.

I never believed them because I would get a good book every now and then and lay on my couch for an entire day, or two, or a week, and read through the entire book or series. How can I have ADD when I can clearly hyperfixate on one book to the point that I'd forget to eat for an entire weekend? \n\nMy first prescription was some non-stimulant that had off-label use for ADHD. I basically blacked out for 2 days and don't remember much. Then they put me on concerta which just gave me a headache and made me stare at the wall a lot. Then vyvanse which was incredible and I was finally doing my schoolwork instead of just talking to people when I was supposed to study, but it kept me up all night. I'd have to take melatonin and benadryl just to fall asleep. \n\nNow I'm settled on an Adderall XR in the morning and an IR around lunch. I graduated top of my class from grad school, I have a great job, two small businesses, overall much better quality of life. \n\nLittle tip: I take a tolerance break for a weekend every few weeks. Seems to make the meds more effective overall."

You‚Äôre now able to reach the items on the shelf, but you still have to climb up the steps. Taking that metaphor a step further, everyone else is tall enough to reach. \n\nYou‚Äôll find there are days when the meds cause you to focus on the wrong thing. Or where you just can‚Äôt focus despite them. Or where you take them and still forget to the thing you were supposed to do. \n\nSo, what I‚Äôm saying is, there will be times when your ADHD is still on full display, despite the medication. Just don‚Äôt beat yourself up about it and try not to make negative comparisons between yourself and others. \n\nYou have your step stool now - just take it one step at a time."

Fast foward to November of my senior year I started at a new psychiatric office and the dr immediately noticed I had add behaviors and put me on vyvanse that worked somewhat but not too much and there was no generic so I asked to be switched to meds with a generic and he started me on Adderall and my life changed forever. I was able to read my textbooks once and retain the info instead of reading the same page 5x and understanding nothing, I was able to pay attention for a whole class period without getting agitated, I was able to be more social because my brain finally worked fast enough to converse... it was already the end of that semester so not enough time to see how it effected my grades but the next semester, my final semester in college, I got a 3.9 gpa my highest ever ( I got all A‚Äôs but my college does A+=4.33, A=4, A-= 3.667) that semester I was also able to land my dream internship for the summer and then I was offered a full time job halfway through for when I returned from teaching English in Spain.

Which one worked best for you.\n\nI got Medikinet, which contains the same drug as Ritalin (Methylphenidate), but has a different realease mechanism. It is delayed and thus last about 8 hours, but the initial push is not as strong ( I would actually prefer it that way, because it enables you to be productive for a longer time and I am not really looking for a high). Do you know how it works with Ritalin. Is it also partially delayed and are there any other differences? I started with 10 mg, which did nothing. I took 20mg yesterday and nothing again. I took 40mg today and I cant really tell, if it is doing a lot a part from the dry mouth and slightly blurry vision. I feel weird, but I am not sure, if I am actually more productive now and to which extend placebo has to do with it. I thought 40mg would be a pretty decent dose and I dont know, if I should keep increasing it. I also took zopiclone to sleep yesterday (1 am), but I dont think it lasts that long (It is currently 13:50 where I live). \n\nIf someone has any tips or answers, I would greatly appreciate it ;)\n\nBest of luck to you all"

I describe it as having several internal radios, all set to scan, so the stations are regularly changing at varying intervals. When I took Adderall and my mind went quiet, I looked at the person I was with and said, ‚Äúis this what ‚Äònormal‚Äô feels like??‚Äù It was almost eerie, but it was incredible. I sometimes experience imposter syndrome with the diagnosis, especially because I‚Äôve only recently been diagnosed in adulthood, but moments like that shut down that feeling pretty quickly."

It won't give you an idea of what it's like to not have ADHD. If anything you probably \\*feel\\* more like a non-ADHD people when you aren't on the pill, the pill allows you to do things non-ADHD people can do not make you feel like them.

I also gave up trying to force myself to study, and this carried on until my second year of university. \n\nI went from not reading a single book until I was 19 to reading dozens of books per year. I‚Äôm now a graduate student, and I don‚Äôt think I would be where I am now if it wasn‚Äôt for the medication‚Äîespecially when I‚Äôm in a field that requires a lot of reading."

Tasks cause me less mental discomfort now and I'm more able to fend off distractions and im no longer mentally exhausted at the end of the day. But if I choose to procrastinate or play a game for 3 hours I'll still do it.

    "comment": "I am so happy for you! It is wild and I can totally relate-\nI had started taking ritalin a couple years back but never got to a therapeutic dose, so never got any results and just stopped going to my doctor. (Shocking, I know lol)  \nSince that time, I started doing a lot of work on building coping, management, and organizational skills. I started a mindfulness and meditation practice- which have benefited me HUGELY. I recently started back to school (for the 4th time) and decided to return to my doctor and commit to it this time. \nThe first month, I didn't experience any results. When he adjusted my dose the second month (a few weeks ago), I was at work and suddenly realized I was JUST WORKING. I wasn't constantly watching the clock. I didn't feel like I was about to jump out of my skin from being so restless. I wasn't gnawing on the inside of my cheek, like I have my ENTIRE life. I didn't FEEL anything. I didn't feel extra motivated or driven or like I was ON something. I just noticed what I WASN'T feeling. And I started tearing up. I could not believe it was possible to feel this way. I always wondered HOW people DO it? Why did everyone else just always seem to be fine and not like they were going crazy, too??? THIS is how. They don't experience the CONSTANT, RELENTLESS feeling of overwhelming restlessness. \nIt made me a little sad to think of just how much easier my life COULD have been and how different my life would look at this point. The things I could have done.... \nWhen I took it and sat down to study, it was the same thing. I just noticed that my mind hadn't been wandering while I was reading. I wasn't constantly opening new tabs because, \"Oh yeah- I wanted to look up that thing about that thing I was thinking about the other day,\" which would lead to me opening more tabs to look at more things that popped into my head that were completely unrelated to what I NEEDED to be doing. When my son kept saying, \"Hey- can you look at this real quick?\" I didn't immediately feel anger and frustration because my attention was being yanked away from whatever I was reading. I just looked at what he wanted to show me, and then WENT RIGHT BACK TO WHAT I HAD BEEN READING.... CALMLY. \nIt's been absolutely shocking to realize just how completely pervasive and destructive my symptoms have been in every aspect of my life. \nI never doubted I had ADHD. I was always painfully aware, yet I STILL let some part of me tell myself that I was probably exaggerating the degree to which my symptoms were interfering in my life and I probably COULD just learn to try harder, apply myself more, and Just Do The Thing. It has been such a relief to find out that none of that was the case and that there is another, better way to live and experience the world. \nI'm deeply proud of the strength, grit, and resilience I've always shown and this has actually made me feel better about myself because I am shocked at the improvements I was able to make and the things I've been able to accomplish (though much later in life than most people and still not to the same level as many people). \nBefore, if I'd think of something I wanted to do in life, I'd immediately lower my expectations and think, \"Well, that's probably not going to happen- but maybe SOME DAY!\" It's been bittersweet, but I finally feel like I'm one of those people that get to have big dreams, too.  It really *is* just a matter of me applying myself, and now I actually have that ability."

I know this sub can't diagnose obviously but I am just wondering if it sounds like it's worth looking into medication.\n\nI regularly find new things that I love and get SUPER into them, then quit the next day or next couple of days. One example is I went to a coding bootcamp and spent 80 hours a week writing code and LOVED IT and picked it up super fast. Then I finished and didn't code for a couple months except for 1 or 2 days and those days I remembered how much I loved to code and did it for like 10 straight hours, only to not touch the project again. I am now back into it and over the last month spent 3 weeks coding every day all day loving it, then the last week I can't get off reddit to code even when I know I should. \n\nMy whole life, I get super super excited about things (like coding, learning guitar, new language, working out, reading, fishing, investing to name just a few), and then quit after a couple days for something else new. Coding is the one thing I've managed to keep coming back to enough to get pretty good. But even then, it's a couple days of hardcore learning, then just nothing, then I remember it again and repeat.\n\nI also always forget little things, like switching the laundry, or if my wife gives me 2 things to do I forget the second one after doing the first. No chance I remember more than 2, and I usually ask her to write them down. I have to repeat her when she tells me so I can remember. When she's talking I 'hear' her but I have to try so damn hard to comprehend it. \n\nI never notice things that are really obvious to other people. Like a furniture rearrangement in the living room, even if I get asked what changed. The garbage is spilled on the ground when I need to pop something in the oven. I step around it, but don't put 2 and 2 together that the garbage is spilled because I was so focused on putting the thing in the oven.\n\nI've started 100 books in my life but only ever finished 1 (an audio book), I've gotten addicted to watching twitch for 10 hours a day for a 2 month period then haven't watched an hour in the last 6 months.\n\nOne time in college I took a friends Adderall just to see what it felt like and I finished all my hw and cleaned my whole room in a couple hours. Start to finish. It was amazing but I just wrote it off as me being lazy. I really resonate with what some people are saying but I also don't want to come off as just a lazy person who is blaming it on ADHD."

The first time I took it I was very confused because my head was completely clear and I had max 10 thoughts at once and I knew what every thought was.\n\nThe euphoria was insane. So insane that I cried because I haven‚Äôt been that happy in years. Being 18 and being genuinely happy for the first time in a long time was incredible. To think something so small can change my entire perspective of the reality I live in was mesmerizing. I was extremely excited to keep taking it from then on.\n\nSince I‚Äôm one month on it I can confidently say I haven‚Äôt experienced that feeling since. Sadly, my body got used to it rather quickly but I‚Äôve definitely been happier and more satisfied with what I‚Äôve got going on in my life.\n\nThe only downsides is that once the Vyvanse wears off you get quite tired and extremely irratible. For me sounds the feeling of clothes and just the way things looked pushed me over the edge. But something that‚Äôs nice is that it doesn‚Äôt happen every time you take it.\n\nI recommend taking Vyvanse 100%. It‚Äôs also very good at controlling appetite for BED (Binge Eating Disorders). It was actually first used for BED, then years after it was approved by the FDA as a ADHD medication."

I take 40 mg of extended release Ritalin and there is a period after taking my medicine that I feel SO CALM, happy, worry-free and significantly less anxious that I feel GUILTY that I feel that way. I have been SO CHOCK FULL of anxiety, depression, rumination, etc...that when I take my medicine I have guilty feelings that I don't feel those things and I wish my medicine would last longer. I don't feel the peak of the prescription for too long. This could totally sound like I am getting high, ha...but in relation to the original post, I had NO IDEA that people felt this way normally! What the heck?!?!?! What have I been missing for my whole life? My anxiety was SO BAD as a small child onward. I found ways to cope, but most were debilitating at times. I want to feel that way as often as I can! I can make better decisions and just be an all-around better person. It's amazing! My kids love me better when I am happier, too!"

This strategy worked, but it was inefficient, and I was neglecting almost all other areas of my life. I tried to use the same strategy in medical school, but it was impossible. There are just too many responsibilities to overcompensate for all of them. It worked for my first year before burning out.

I always studied on public schools, and they are very easy to pass, because the government doesn't want to spend more than the necessary money on you, then I failed my NHE and all college applications, I was stuck, but a friend of mine told me about a free pre-college course thought by some students of the second best university in south america, I applied to that and fortunately passed, those guys were the best teachers I had to this day, I owe them a lot. Fast-foward to November 2017 (11 months after finishing high school) I felt more ready than ever to take the NHE again, a test divided in 2 days, 90 questions and 5 hours of duration per day, and one essay on the first day, it felt like torture, but that was probably the only time in my life that my willpower was strong enough to keep me going, when the results were in, I passed in a federal university in computer engineering with almost the bare minimum score, but I got so freaking happy."

So what happens when you add ritalin is that dopaminergic signalling is massively increased, which your body finds strange, so it decreases the amount of dopamine receptors to try to bring the signalling down to where it was, as that's what your body thinks is right. But it doesn't do this completely, and the result is long term medications causing a slight increase in signalling. This is what causes opioid withdrawals - your body makes less of its own opioids and decreases the receptor count so that when the external source is taken away, the body is left with less stuff that can bind to less receptors, which throws the whole pathway out of whack.\n\nSorry that wasn't a great explanation, I'm struggling for words today. The way the body maintains homeostasis is through feedback loops - in a similar manner to how aircraft will point downward after a gust makes their nose point upward. If it didn't, one small perturbation could throw everything off."

I used Concerta for a while but it didn't have the same effects I wanted like Ritalin did. Ritalin is a medicine that lasts 4 hours and It's really concentrated. Concerta is the same thing but It stretches that 4 hours to 12 hours by lessening it's effect. I needed more effects so I took more than 1 on somedays and thought I would have an heart attack lol. I told this to my doctor and she prescribed me medikinet. Medikinet is similar to both Ritalin and Concerta as in It feels like you took Ritalin in the first 4 hours than the remaining 8 hours is like Concerta, little bit of both."

    "comment": "I would describe tolerance from 2 perspectives. One, being how \"good, euphoric, speedy\" I feel. And the second, being a tolerance in terms of what happens when I DON'T take it for a handful of days.  \n\n\nThe good feeling is still there, still productive, and still able to focus. It's just that you feel it creep up a bit rather than slapping you with it all at once. Im also on vyvanse which is time delayed instead of adderall (in most forms) are insta-release and hit you quicker/harder). So I wouldn't worry too much about not being as proactive down the line. The med will still do it's job.  \n\n\nIt's the SECOND thing, (not taking it for 3,4,5)  days where I see the impact of tolerance the most. I am prescribed to take it every day at certain times like most people, and I've found that if I skip a few days over a holiday weekend or whatever else that distracts me from needing/taking it, then it hits me super hard when I do take it again and it's almost uncontrollable and I feel like I'm on speed or damn near close to a ecstasy jigging feeling. Which is great if I want that, but I don't. I want to focus.  \n\n\nThe body seems to ramp itself down QUICKLY when you stop for a few days altering the balance of chemicals in your brain and leveling off the norepinephrine and dopamine levels back to normal. So that 3+ day break is basically resetting your brain back to \"never taking the adderall\" so slapping it with a full dose after the break is a little hard for me.  \n\n\nSorry for the novel. Hope the info helps. Remind you again, just drink a SHIT TON OF WATER while you're on it to avoid migraines. It depletes your bodies water reserve quickly and can cause dehydration. Take care!"

They signed up with universities and clinics related specifically to ADHD and \"social disorders\". It would put you smack dab in the middle of the hub where new treatments and medications are being tested and developed in your country. Probably your best chance of trying something new.

Lots of people with my exact same experience. \nDoctor never warned me, but if I‚Äôd known it was a possibility I would‚Äôve never tried it - or at least been way more vigilant and caught it earlier to get off it earlier. I ( naively) assumed a side effect would be temporary and if I got one I could just stop and it would resolve itself, but that assumption was incorrect. \n\nHonestly the tinnitus has been one of the most difficult things I‚Äôve dealt with, but I‚Äôm slowly getting more okay with it. Knowing I‚Äôll have to deal with it for the rest of my life though and that it could get worse is stressful - had it get worse after a loud wedding where I forgot my earplugs and didn‚Äôt have the sense to leave.

After a few days that 2.5mg in the morning and 2.5mg in the afternoon wasn't really doing much, so I increased to 5mg in the morning and 5mg in the afternoon. Today is the first day I'm trying 7.5mg in the morning and 7.5mg in the afternoon. I'm about to take my second dose for the day in about 20 minutes, and I actually feel the mornings dose still working, whereas the past several days it had worn off at least an hour ago. For this dosage, I feel a good desire and follow through for productivity, but no \"move move move\" like I did my first day on 2.5mg. The Doctor is going to check in with me in a month to see how it's going and if I need an change in dosage or a change in meds.  \n\nHow do I know I may need to change my dosage after a month? Will this increase in focus become a baseline? Or will the increase in focus fade off and I may need higher dosage? \n\nI guess I'm not 100% sure on what I should be looking for as an end result.

    "comment": "Absolutely agree with your mother.  A doctor should be diagnosing you based on your symptoms and challenges vs the diagnostic criteria, not if he's 'a fan' of a diagnosis or not.  I know it seems like a major setback, but he's just wasting your time by sending you home to do a screening quiz that he could have done himself.\n\nI think most of us have also been diagnosed with depression but it's not necessarily an either/or.  With the mess that ADHD can have on our lives, is it really a surprise?  Antidepressants can certainly be helpful, but that doctor seems to be viewing them as a cure-all, confusing depression with frustration/unhappiness.\n\nCongratulations for standing up for yourself.  That is extremely difficult to do, especially with a doctor that stands between you and getting the right help.  I hope you can find a different doctor without having to wait 15 months, but even if you do, I hope they are able to help."

Sometimes it‚Äôs ignorance, sometimes it‚Äôs because they want to manage a co-morbid disorder first that means mimics ADHD symptoms (ex depression or bipolar), or they just have a tough love kind of approach and want you to ‚Äúbuild your case‚Äù. Regardless it‚Äôs not a good approach. \n\nIf I‚Äôve learned anything after 20 years of treatment is that you have to make yourself informed about your condition (research the symptoms, reviews on meds, etc) and be resourceful like having multiple options with doctors.  In your situation I would definitely fill out that online screening he asked of you, go through with his follow up appointment, find and make other appointments/get on waiting lists, and explore telehealth options (which could be helpful to get the ball rolling on stimulants and then easier to switch to a local option). Keep in mind that some telehealth services say they treat adhd but don‚Äôt prescribe stimulants (so ask ahead). Some that are good options are ahead, done and adhd online.\n\nActually most of what I‚Äôve said is on CHADD the https://chadd.org/adhd-news/adhd-news-adults/finding-telemedicine-services/"

Like you, I graduated high school and college with fairly good grades and got by fine (albeit with a lot of stress and overwhelm). Doctors aren‚Äôt infallible and they also only have the answers for what they ask/what they tell you. Was this person an older doctor? He sounds like he is working from an older mode of being - adhd in the DSM-5 has broadened to include more inattentive symptoms and if he‚Äôs working from a ‚Äúthey‚Äôre fidgeting so they have it‚Äù mode then he‚Äôs definitely not going to believe you. That said, this guy sounds like a pretty big dingus, and hate to say it might be a sexism aspect, as doctors sometimes have superiority complex towards young female patients (even more so if BIPOC).\n\nAlso I‚Äôm in the field of psychology and overt behaviours aren‚Äôt always a great measurement of what is happening internally. Many people with adhd exhibit different behavioural symptoms with the same cause. Your doctor sounds stubborn as hell and maybe is just stuck on a diagnosis. That said, depression can cause difficulty focusing as well so it‚Äôs hard to say. The assessment centre I went to told me that 1 in 4 people have ADHD in adulthood so it‚Äôs far from being uncommon. \n\nThere may be a couple of options for you:\n1) if you are in post secondary, get hooked up with the accessibility department and they will aid you in getting a diagnosis. They may be able to help you find an assessment centre and apply to get a bursary to pay for it. \n2) talk to your family doctor to fast track you to a diagnosis or give you other options. Sometimes out of city options is the fastest option or if you‚Äôre wanting it fast and have the $$$ you can get a diagnosis very quickly through an assessment centre in the city \n3) file a complaint of the psychiatrist and request another doctor, one who specializes in ADHD. There should be an anonymous complaint line.  \n\nThe fact is you know yourself best, I‚Äôm not saying self diagnosis is always correct but I think you should trust your gut and get a full assessment to really make sure. At least then you can get the peace of mind. There are aspects of ADHD that aren‚Äôt behaviour that this doctor can‚Äôt see like working memory and processing speed that are associated with ADHD."

If possible, considering the existence of rail and cheap domestic flights, you could look into seeing a practitioner outside of your city for a diagnosis, and ask your primary care provider in your current city to prescribe the meds they recommend.\n\nEdit: also worth talking to your primary car physician and ask if they will prescribe you meds if you saw someone privately in your city and they gave you a diagnosis and initial prescription. 200 Euros sucks but it will be worth it to get the help you need, especially if you can make that a one or two time cost rather than something you have to pay every month.\n\nfinally just want to underscore how invalid what he said was. i go to a competitive uni in the us and you'd be shocked at how many people here have undiagnosed adhd. female gifted children frequently make it through k-12 and even college undiagnosed due to the differences in how adhd is expressed which correlates with gender. and being academically talented makes it easier to stay under the radar. my k-12 gifted program required teachers to write up individual reports each year discussing academic but also social progress, and in retrospect these reports show very clear adhd symptoms, but they were brushed off as being antisocial/awkward and lazy. it didn't help that both my parents grew up with undiagnosed adhd and saw my extreme procrastination and other behaviors as normal."

There may be individuals who he treats that have ADHD that may not need or want treatment for it, but ADHD has massive comorbidities with anxiety, depression, and ASD.\n\nWhen I went to my psych I wanted to specifically try stimulants as a first treatment method. I specifically told her: \"I know stimulants have an inverse reaction in individuals with ADHD. If they make me more energetic, hyperactive, or anything of the sort then it's clear we're going down the wrong path, but if they make me calmer and more focused then we know that we've got the diagnosis right\". The latter occurred - my partner indicated I was far less manic on ADHD meds and we've stuck with that treatment since.\n\nI know you didn't ask for advice, but I have some that I hope might help. You're going to have to bridge the gap with him in some way or find another doctor - those are your only two options.\n\nI would take the approach with your doctor of ''Hey, I get that you feel that this isn't a proper diagnosis. My concern is research has consistently been showing it to be more and more common than we initially thought in adults. If you're not comfortable starting out with stimulants because they're a scheduled substance I get that - it's your medical license. Can we at least try something like Strattera and see what effects we have? This may not seem like a big deal to you, but this has been something I've struggled with for years. I'm more than happy to submit to any tests you want or steps you need to have taken. My concern is every existing research study shows untreated ADHD results in significantly higher occurrences of anxiety, depression, and overall unhappiness with life due to the resulting inability to be ones best self. This means that my prior depressive and anxiety based episodes could have been a comorbidity and I want to treat the root cause and be the best person I can - not just put a bandaid on things that isn't going to be as effective long term.''\n\nIf that fails - I've found online ADHD psychiatrists to be very understanding and effective. There are many options in that regard that may even be more convenient for you then seeing this specific doctor. I think a large part of that is individuals who work in telemedicine are likely early adopters of technology and keep up to date with ongoing changes and research."

At least you'll have a real time frame for getting the help you want (though 15 months does hurt), and maybe you can get bumped up on their schedule if spots open on their end.\n\nAlso, see if there are any psychiatrists in your state who offer video appointments. Covid really opened things up on that front.\n\nThis guy sounds like he's, frankly, a piece of shit *and* a shit doctor, and I'm sorry that was the best option you had available at the time."

There aren't any other psychiatrists within that area without long wait times?\n\nIn the end you may not have adhd but you owe it to yourself to get comprehensive testing, not just answer 18 questions. I would try to find a place to get tested. Do some legwork and talk to your primary care about a referral.\n\nI wonder if the psychiatrist would prescribe a non stimulant like Strattera. He may just be opposed to stimulants. Or maybe your primary care would if they wouldn't prescribe a controlled substance."

I went to someone that specializes in adhd and my experience was not like this AT ALL. I actually felt way better even after my first appointment before I get tested. The psychologist told me straight up ‚Äújust because you did well in school doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt have adhd‚Äù. It felt nice to hear that and it came from a professional‚Äôs mouth. If you go back to him you‚Äôll probably just waste your time and money unfortunately. 15 months sounds like a long time and it will probably feel even longer. I had to wait 6 months to get my appointment. But it really would be way more worth it to wait that amount of time than go back to him because it sounds like he isn‚Äôt interested in actually helping you. If you do get in with the place that has a 15 month wait there is a good chance you‚Äôll get in earlier than that because usually when people cancel or something they will move everyone else up on the list.

Simply put she would not be prescribing me ANYTHING. Ok fine I just want at diagnosis  please. \n\n3rd appointment my diagnosis is super inconclusive and she wanted to referral me to a specialist AND PUT ME ON DRUGS. I mean what the hell?!? That's right, with an inconclusive diagnosis she was wanting me to test some \"life ruining drugs that she would never prescribe\". It must have been a screening comment for drug seekers. \n\nAnyway.

    "comment": "> I feel like there is no choice other than to go back. I won't get an appointment with a normal psychiatrist for months. \n\nOkay but take a sec and really think about what these options actually are. Let's remove the bit where this asshole is \"technically a psychiatrist\" and talk in terms of symptom management:\n\n1. You wait 15 months for a chance to get support and treatment for your symptoms\n2. You get no support or treatment for your symptoms for the foreseeable future, plus you spend some amount of time regularly being told that your symptoms are fake\n\nIt sucks A LOT that there's no option 3 where you can get support and treatment sooner, but that's the reality, unfortunately. And, given that, I think it should be pretty obvious that option 1 is the best one available to you.\n\nIn the meantime, even if you don't have access to medical treatment for your symptoms, you may be able to get cognitive-behavioural treatment. These tools work a lot better *with* medication, but they can certainly be useful even without. Because psychologists and therapists are not medical doctors, it's often easier to find and get an appointment with one. They may not be able to help you get an official medical diagnosis or provide medication, but they can provide other symptom management tools (and they may be willing to provide support when you do speak to another psych in a year or so, to provide further context and confirmation of your symptoms).\n\nAlso, last bit of advice - ask your GP to test you for thyroid disorder and any other physical disorders that can cause ADHD-like symptoms. Thyroid disorder can cause issues that looks almost *identical* to ADHD. Many doctors will get this test as a matter of course while determining if ADHD is an appropriate diagnosis, but not always. It's a good idea to make sure you've looked into all the possible causes of your symptoms, but *also* it's a strong indication to future doctors that you are *not* drug-seeking; few drug-seekers would be interested in providing doctors with a possible alternative to providing them the drugs they want, right? Showing that you're open to alternative explanations for your symptoms (and being willing to undergo something inconvenient and unpleasant like a blood test as part of that) is a power reassurance to doctors who may be putting themselves at risk of serious repercussions if they end up prescribing heavily controlled medication (like Adderall) to a patient who turns out to be misleading them. Plus obviously if it turns out that you *do* have thyroid disorder, you'll obviously want to know!"

Explained how I got to my conclusion that I believed ADHD-PI was likely in my case.\n\nI also took a couple of tests that I found on the internet and the results. He had a copy of one that he asked me to fill out on the day also.\n\nI was diagnosed at the end of the hour and started Ritalin the next week after blood tests and heart monitoring.\n\nI definitely am very grateful that the Doctor listen to me and my concerns. My husband wasn't convinced and my mum never noticed my 'issues' apart from my diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder and General Anxiety Disorder with Suicidal Idealation at 11 years old. \n\nIt took 4 months from getting my referral from a GP to actually seeing the psychiatrist and the waiting periods seem to be getting worse.

It's still a stimulant so it doesn't matter if you have ADHD or not, if not used correctly it can get you high.\n\nThis is correct. Stimulants work the same way for most people (excluding some who process it too quickly or too slowly), regardless of whether you have ADHD or not. [Here's a statement from Dr. Barkley on the topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/oss7ei/official_dr_russell_barkley_summer_ama_thread/h6vmpt3/).\n\n> but I was getting high off it and promptly stopped using it.\n\nJust FYI, it's really common to experience euphoria when starting stimulant treatment. It's totally normal, and not a sign that you don't have ADHD or that you're abusing the medication. It's just a normal side effect that goes away over time. *Do be careful* if you might have another disorder for which stimulants are contraindicated, like bipolar disorder. There are people with BD who take stimulants safely, but you definitely need to keep a careful eye on it.\n\n**Edit:** Locking this thread due to rampant misinformation.

She strongly cautioned that this was a side effect, temporary, and part of why these medications were prone to abuse. She has me note my effects and side effects for at least a week following any changes, and then I follow up with her for a quick appointment. Then we finish the month at that dose provided there aren‚Äôt bad side effects and follow up again. \n\nThis structure makes sense, and kind of protects against if it‚Äôs not a myth.  I appreciate the clear forewarning of what to expect.  In the end, I didn‚Äôt ever feel strongly euphoric despite knowing that many others do. When I told her that (and knowing that I was experiencing therapeutic effects), she said that made it a good choice for me so far. \n\nIf your prescriber isn‚Äôt helping you ‚Äúengineer‚Äù things this way, it‚Äôs likely worth a second opinion. Remember that you can start with one provider for an evaluation/diagnosis, but see someone you have a better rapport with for ongoing medication management and counseling if you‚Äôd like. \n\nAlso remember that a lot of diagnoses and the mental health structure in our society is defined by things we can measure.  AKA X, Y, and Z symptoms are called depression (for example), but then a medication comes along that improves those symptoms for 75% of people. Over time, that group of 75% is categorized as depression while the other 25% are treated and researched further. Because the medication doesn‚Äôt work, diagnoses are recategorized."

I stuck with it and the giddy feeling went away but it continued to be a huge help.\n Adderall never makes me feel amped up when I take the right dosage but if I take too much it gives me an uncomfortable tweaky feeling. In contrast, my friends who don't have ADHD and take adderall for fun seem to get high from it and it affects their mood and behavior totally differently than it does mine. So IMO there is probably at least some merit to what your doctor is saying. Meds all affect you differently so I would say to keep trying until you find the right rx and dose. \n\nSide note: since you are unsure about your ADHD diagnosis, sometimes things like depression and anxiety can act like ADHD. Sometimes the right antidepressant can make a world of difference without stimulants."

One provider convinced me to try Vyvanse, which is a similar stimulant medication, and I felt all kinds of strange and terrible the week I took that. Went back to the Adderall and it‚Äôs worked since. So in my experience you can have ADHD and still have strange reactions to ADHD meds. \n\nMy first provider gave me 5mg pills of Adderall and told me that I should take one, sit down to study/work and if didn‚Äôt feel any change from it after 4 hours, I should try taking two and if I still felt nothing, try three the next day. If I felt nothing after three, he didn‚Äôt think it was ADHD. [Caveat: my ADHD may not be as severe as many others as I was already at a very good law school at the time despite being diagnosed as a child and never medicated, so someone with more severe symptoms might need a stronger dose before feeling effects.] \nThe point is that provider seemed to have a similar mentality to your current doctor. For me 5mg of Adderall helped me get more work done in a 4 hour period than I ever had before and I never felt euphoric or high, more ‚Äúlocked in‚Äù but if he had chosen to put me on Vyvanse instead, he might have concluded I simply didn‚Äôt have ADHD and my life would be worse for it. \n\nDefinitely change providers until you find someone more experienced and open-minded and willing to work with you.

Currently I‚Äôm taking a mood stabilizer and it‚Äôs kept me episode-free for years now. When my ADHD was confirmed about 5 years post-bipolar diagnosis, I tried Strattera first. It threw me into a mixed episode. My practitioner was hesitant to try anything else but he put me on Vyvanse. This had an incredibly sedating effect and having to take multiple naps a day just wasn‚Äôt feasible for me. It‚Äôs been about 7 years since I quit taking Adderall inappropriately, so with extreme caution we tried it out. Now, I‚Äôm on 20mg Adderall but with the mood stabilizer in the mix it actually doesn‚Äôt even help 100%, which is a far cry from achieving euphoria at just 10mg in the past. The mood stabilizer has really helped with staving off the ‚Äúhigh.‚Äù My practitioner thinks I could increase the dose safely so it can be more effective but I‚Äôm too nervous to try. I‚Äôm just thankful I found something to work even just 50% that hasn‚Äôt thrown me into a life ruining scenario again.

From what I've gathered it seems like ADHD is a bit poorly defined and poorly understood because is it doesn't always present in the same way for everyone and varies wildly in severity. The high/not-high thing might be true MOST of the time but the brain chemistry of ADHD is all over the place as evidenced by different medications working for some but not others. \n\nThat being said, when I was recently diagnosed i tried adderall up to I think 20mg and decided it wasn't for me because it potentiated my anxiety and i got crazy ear pain from clenching my jaw. I would not characterize it as enjoyable or \"getting high\". I didn't experience any euphoria or anything like that. So on one hand this is to me a confirmation of my ADHD because I didn't get high, but on the other hand I wonder if the fact that it made me really anxious and all keyed up was a sort of \"high\" that just wasn't a very enjoyable one."

I fear that perhaps the hyper part for me caused my brain to develop as a child (and i was an energetic mofo) so when adult hits and body gets old, the hyper part goes away leaving a deficit. Stimulants def rebalance me. But then again, reality of biology is that everyone is diff, diff deficits, diff mechanics of how deficits work, and then drugs effects on the body is not the same for everyone. Like dopamine issues with add and adhd people, it maybe an absorption issue, it maybe an overproduction or under production, or over absorption or under. Its still similar results of not getting enough dopamine but mechanics are diff."

Because a lot of us experience a kind of euphoria for the first week or so. It‚Äôs not actually high. It‚Äôs just that your brain is working the way it should for the first time and all of a sudden everything is easy and quiet and fast and you kind of feel giddy and confused and weird because it‚Äôs so different from how you usually feel inside.  \n\nThis isn‚Äôt being high. This is literally just how other people walk around feeling all the fucking time.  \n\nTHOSE people will get high with meds.

    "comment": "I think your doctor is jumping to conclusions. Which doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that he is wrong. There is a lot of research that some individuals who are ADHD are ADHD because of traumatic events. The last time I mentioned this I was ripped by an individual because ADHD is a neurological disorder. To clarify most patients who are diagnosed as ADHD are not put through an EEG which is the only way to accurately determine if a neurological disorder is present. Also while there isn‚Äôt a lot of research it is clear that trauma can change the brain chemistry particularly in young children. \n\nAnyway because of the trauma factor it is possible that an individual‚Äôs ADHD struggles are in fact PTSD, and or hyper vigilance reactionary.  \n\nBecause your doctor is assuming several different conclusions I personally think that it is important to see a neurologist.  There is some correlation to the Ritalin theory but only ‚Äúsome.‚Äù There are a number of reasons why Ritalin wasn‚Äôt right for you. \n\nIf you go back to the doctor I would encourage you to talk to him about fasting. In Europe (eastern) most doctors have their patients suspected of BD BPD fast prior to beginning medication. This allows the body to balance hormones and heal some. I think it‚Äôs wise to get a true diagnosis and not a guess (regardless of how educated it is) particularly if it involves long term medication."

    "comment": "There's a lot of overlap in terms of symptoms for ADHD and BPD. \n\nHere's the deal. \n\nA person that does have ADHD, unless taking a dose in excess or incorrect taking their meds, should not get High on a stimulant. \n\nThe stimulant might not work, It might get some symptoms worse as it's not a good fit with the person's brain chemistry. \nIt should not give you euphoria. \n\nPeople who do get euphoric (and euphoric is a very specific term that does not mean a slight boost in motivation), you either don't have ADHD, took too much OR have another underlying issue. \n\nExample: if you have ADHD and BPD, I don't think stimulants are a viable treatment, not because you don't have adhd, but because the BPD will be the thing that makes you euphoric from the stimulant. The same way people with BPD can't take anti depressants because they're at risk of entering a manic phase. \n\nAdhd combined with BPD is a whole other brain chemistry issue diferent from just ADHD. \n\nBasically, it can be one of 2 things: \n\n- you may have been incorrectly diagnosed with ADHD when the correct diagnose is BD2 or BPD. \n\nOr \n\n- the first diagnosis was correct but you have a comorbitie with BPD/BD2 that is causing the reaction to the stimulants."

If you‚Äôre taking a low dose of ritalin it really shouldn‚Äôt get you high if you suffer from ADHD. Now if you‚Äôre taking too high of a dose it could still get you high absolutely however this would be something more common with a stimulant like adderall not Ritalin. But you even mentioned you were on a low dose which is why I find it unlikely. But I think it‚Äôs also possible that some people mistake side effects when they first start a medication for being high‚Äî although you said you have experience with the feeling. So it‚Äôs hard to say. I do know it‚Äôs not uncommon for doctors to misdiagnose though. My sister was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and then eventually diagnosed with only ADHD.

To confirm, yes, 80mg would be the maximum DAILY intake, not maximum per dose. \n\nMy doc prescribes me 60mg IR a day as a standard adult dose. The pills I get are 10mg each, and he's left it to me to work out what works for me in terms of scheduling.\n\nAfter some trial and error I settled on 10mg per dose, at roughly 3hr intervals. I take my first an hour before I need to get up, and go back to bed. I generally only end up taking 50mg a day unless I'm having a very long day, for various reasons.\n\nI tried 20mg at a time doses and my resting heart rate hit 120 mid-morning. Didn't seem like a good idea. Each pill lasts 4hrs, so the 3hr intervals mean I don't wait for one to run out before I take the next. \n\nI'd probably make it a 2.5hr interval so I could fit in the 60mg, but I mask at work to protect my chronically ill partner, so that would mean multiple trips outside to safely take my meds, and that just doesn't seem like it would work for me.\n\nWhen I first started, my doc warned me about taking my last dose too late, but I wasn't having any sleep issues (I rarely have, ever), and I was getting a horrible anxiety drop between dinner and bed when the last pill wore off, so now I'm less fussy about how late I'll take it.\n\nAs long as you go slowly with the trial and error, it's a pretty good way to settle on the right dose and schedule.

As the doctor knows the body so does the pharmacist know medications. Working in pharma taught me that though. Any questions about meds I‚Äôve had, I‚Äôve asked coworkers.

    "comment": "No, I've never taken the slow release version. From what I've read, it's more commonly prescribed to kids, who can't easily manage a dosage schedule through the day. But I have heard of a lot of people who take the slow release in the morning, then a small booster dose of instant in the afternoon.\n\nMy doctor went straight to Ritalin IR, I assume because it makes fine-tuning a dosage simpler. The pills are 10mg each, so you can take 10mg or 20mg at a time, and work out the best way to spread them over the day.\n\nIf you feel like you're not getting what you want from your meds, it's always worth having a talk to your doctor about other options. Either a top-up dose of IR in the afternoons, or switching over to IR completely. Or even trying a different medication if it's not doing much for you. If it helps, when I was taking 40mg a day my doctor kept telling me that was a low dose for an adult. I don't know if there's a difference in the impact of 20mg between the instant and slow release versions, but if they have the same impact, you're on a fairly low dose atm. \n\nI can generally tell when my meds are wearing off - that's when the anxiety spike hits. If I'm lucky, I'm already winding down for bed and I don't notice it as much."

We don't get those rules about refills etc., you can get up to 3 months of meds and that's pretty much it. If you get more depends on your doctor. So sometimes people will get a starting dose of, let's say, 5mg, but the doctor will tell them to up the dose to 10mg or 15mg and see what works best. So when they run out they just get another prescription ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nWe have a system monitoring the prescriptions that all doctors can see, though, so you can't just jump from doctor to doctor and abuse that - they would find out very quickly, and you need specific qualifications as a doctor to prescribe Ritalin.

This information is readily available so I don't think I need to provide a source. Family doctors often prescribe benzodiazepines for example which are controlled although not in the same category as methylphenidate."

I have a bit better mood and can actually enjoy songs in the car instead of feeling like each song is blah and continuously scanning through them. It doesn‚Äôt make me hyperactive or jittery. In fact, I‚Äôve napped when it‚Äôs kicked in more than a few times. Not sure what I make of it. I feel like my brain is a bit more active and less sluggish. Also, I sleep really well on it.

I very quickly noticed that my foggy brain went away and I feel so clear headed. I also have energy but it's not too high, which would often happen to me in short bursts. This would cause me to power through tasks and chores around the house since I knew that energy and motivation wouldn't last long. Stuff was often left half finished and I would be incapable of doing anything for the rest of the day. Now, I feel I can just do things without any issues.\n\nI also feel my mood has been quite calm and relaxed whilst still feeling awake and my past unexpected periods of feeling frustrated for no reason, have gone.

I barely ate, not in a concerning way but I was just never hungry. It sucked because we had the ‚Äúfinish your plate‚Äù rule. I didn‚Äôt want to eat at meals times and wanted to have small snacks throughout the day. It didn‚Äôt do much for my focus or anything and only helped with my elementary grade outcast problem. When I was about 12, I was eating with my stepmother and grandmother but I had forgotten to take it. It was in the summer so my dose was lowered as opposed to the school year. I paused for a second and thought out loud ‚Äúwow, I‚Äôm eating more than usual, I wonder if it‚Äôs got to do with my meds‚Äù. I think I made a connection to medicine affecting diet b cause I had heard something about my dads meds affecting his diet. My stepmother kind of froze for a moment before asking if not taking the medicine made me feel different. Being one day off of meds I didn‚Äôt. By the end of the month we found out all the horrible things Ritalin does. When taken for long amounts of time before and during puberty Ritalin can affect brain development and even damage it. It explained why I never wanted to eat, why it made me feel so zombie like. She took me off of it as soon as my dad said we could. I tried one or two other meds but they didn‚Äôt work and even had similar results. I didn‚Äôt take anything for my ADHD for years because I was afraid that if I took them I would lose all of my weight again. I, to this day, subconsciously rest my hands over my ribs because I could always feel them no matter how much I ate while on Ritalin. I‚Äôm on Vivance now and have been for a few years. It‚Äôs still hard to be a functional human some days, it‚Äôs much better."

I had to keep it to myself as people would make stupid suggestions and forget that it was always around in my life. They put me on Vyvanse first after 6 months of having appointments with a psychologist. Shot up into my neck, giving me pain in the bottom of the back of my skull where I don't usually feel tension. When they changed Ritalin, it wasn't straight away but after about 2 weeks, the muscle issues I have had and tried so many things on after 5 years (ACupunture/Chiro/Pyshio) WENT AWAY!  Apparently, almost a 3rd of ADHD people have muscle issues, and comorbidity dyspraxia when younger. So without that discomfort, I could obviously focus better. Now, it's not like being high. Things are just clearer... things are connecting easier for longer....  It was helpful. But when too much routine is shaken up, I feel like I'm bad at everything all over again. however, objectively, It was useful for what it is and does, and it's like putting on lenses. Where you see clearly, you can build the habits you need to function and think.  \nThere is a Stigma about Meds and Tolerances eventually building it, but I'm an advocate of listening to your body and some people have been on it for 10 years and it's been fine. I feel you need to make building blocks for your life and daily function.  Hopefully, you can ween yourself off of it because neuroplasticity means you can build new neuro pathways that develop different ways of thinking that eventually become actions. However, don't feel ashamed if Meds are working and you still need them 10 years later. That's for you to assess and consider.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want to learn more about my experience, feel free to DM.\n\nGood luck!"

Ordinary ADHD is much easier to treat, there is no proven effective treatment for SCT, though Atomoxetine/Strattera did show effects in some scientific studies.\n\nDepending on the severity of your SCT you can expect to have a low quality social life and find yourself daydreaming and spending a lot of your time doing nothing, find yourself facing anxiety and depression. Driving might be dangerous too so I don't recommend it. SCT like ADHD is selective, ADHD might not let someone focus on a task for a longer period of time, SCT does not allow you to focus on the task AT ALL. However if there is a subject or activity your brain finds interesting your SCT symptoms may not affect you.\n\nIf so find a job that your brain finds interesting and where you can't be held financially/criminally accountable for making little mistakes. Explain to people what you have and surround yourself with people that are willing to accept your \"social weirdness\" if that's one of your symptoms and are supportive and are not going to blame you for your disease. Also you can stop blaming yourself now.\n\nI wish you the best of luck in the future, live to retain hope for a possible cure someday.

Take an empty pill bottle to an urgent care, let them know you lost the prescribing psychiatrist due to your insurance and you couldn't find someone to take over the prescription in time. Hopefully, this can buy you a month.\n\nDuring that month, search in network for a new psychiatrist. They won't all be as negligent as this one. \n\nIf you can get into your primary care doc quickly, they might also help you with this. They might write a script and/or they might know a psych who treats adult ADHD."

    "comment": "Stories like this infuriate me. I have a MS in clinical psych where I specialized in ADHD. I left my program and the entire field before becoming a full fledged therapist because I was so disenchanted with loads of things about psych. One of the biggest disappointments was learning that most disorders should really be on a continuum rather than a binary, you rather have it or you don't, kind of thing. But they're setup the way they are because it's easier to bill insurance if things are categorical like that. \n\nThat is to say, anyone who sees you one time and tells you \"this is the way things are\" and invalidates your lived experience like they did is a f*cking idiot.\n\nLiterally the only thing you need to diagnose an adult with ADHD is for them to fill out an 18 item self-report form (https://add.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/adhd-questionnaire-ASRS111.pdf). THAT'S IT. \n\nDon't let this person take away something that helps you. Go to a different psychiatrist or hell, just go to your general practitioner. You don't need to see a psychiatrist for meds."

I call 3 more times over the day.  No answer.  Like, no one‚Äôs there.  The next day (Friday), I drive there.  There‚Äôs a note on the door saying, ‚Äúclosed due to out-of-town convention‚Äù.  \n\nSo I space out for a weekend, and I call them Monday at the asscrack of open hours.  By this time, I‚Äôm full withdrawal, crabby as hell, and not taking any shit.  They tell me to come in for an appointment.  I take the next available one.\n\nI talk to my doctor, and she says, ‚ÄúAfter doing some looking, I feel like you either don‚Äôt have ADHD, or don‚Äôt benefit from medication, so I‚Äôm no longer going to prescribe Vyvanse to you.  I will prescribe this new, untested antidepressant to you, though if you‚Äôre interested!‚Äù  I tell her I want my records in my hand in the next 10 minutes.\n\nI go to another doctor, and she tells me that‚Äôs very weird, but gets me my script.  Good to go.\n\n2 months later, my dad, who also went to the same clinic for Vyvanse, but in a different town, tells me his doctor said the same thing to him!\n\nHonestly (and I‚Äôm not a big ‚Äútinfoil hat‚Äù person), I can‚Äôt help but feel like somehow it has to do with the sporadic ADHD med shortages over the past couple years.  I‚Äôm just not smart enough to figure it out, and couldn‚Äôt change anything if I did.\n\nGood luck, OP.

It's probably not going to get better with that prescriber.\n\n\nI had a neuropsych eval and was diagnosed when I was 10 years old. As an adult, my PCP took over my prescription at one point. Then I got a new PCP who wouldn't prescribe any psych medications, so she sent me to psych.\n\n\n\nNew psych says she thinks I'm just depressed and anxious. Well, yeah, my ADHD is unmedicated at this point, so yes, I was feeling rather depressed and anxious about it. She put me on an antidepressant instead. It didn't do anything for me. I kept asking about Vyvanse which worked really well for me previously, and she said she would not prescribe a stimulant without an eval, and I didn't have my a copy of my eval from 20 years ago. So she said I could do one if I really wanted to. So I dropped a couple grand for this stupid eval to tell me what I already knew... Then she comes back and says, \"Well, see here, it says it's mild, you don't *really* need medication, but I can give you a low dose of Concerta.\" I told her Concerta didn't work very well for me as a kid, and I knew Vyvanse did work. And she said, \"Well, you're an adult now, so it might work better.\"\n\n\n\nConcerta was on backorder, so I called her back and asked for Focalin, since it's also a methylphenidate. She said, No, and said Focalin was an amphetamine and she doesn't like to prescribe amphetamines, so I'd just have to wait for Concerta to be back in stock. I insisted Focalin was not an amphetamine, but she wouldn't hear it. 10 min later she calls me back and said she found a medication she can prescribe instead of the Concerta, and that it's called Focalin, and very condescendingly explained how it's very similar to Concerta. B*tch, that's literally what I just said!\n\n\nOne of my friends convinced me to switched to another psych, so I did, and he gave me Vyvanse on my first visit. He was appalled when I told him about my previous psych. It wasn't like I was requesting anything crazy, 20 mg of Vyvanse.\n\n\nSave yourself the headache and switch now.

I've had insomnia and a brain that never quieted down since I was 13. I was probably 35 when he declares this after meeting me one time and insists I just need to go to a sleep clinic and they'll fix my insomnia. That was a joke. I have insomnia, I take meds to sleep. The sleep clinic said I couldn't take any medicine. That it messes with the test. So I asked them, are you just going to watch me lay in bed? They told me I needed to go to sleep. Eyeroll. After about two hours of not sleeping and them coming over the loudspeaker telling me to go to sleep (cuz that didn't cause anxiety, or anything) they let me take meds. \nThey had no suggestions besides maybe getting a breast reduction. \nWaste of money, waste of time and so much anxiety brought on by a doctor that is supposed to help with anxiety. Got a different doctor, one that listens. She had me get tested for a bunch of stuff, including ADHD, which had never been mentioned before. \nAnd my whole life fell into place. 80s girls didn't get diagnosed. Which leads to depression, anxiety, insomnia. I always described my brain at night as racing thoughts. Which never screamed ADHD to any of my doctors. I guess I was always describing it wrong. Not racing thoughts but ALL the thoughts with music in the background. \nIt was wonderful to find out and also made me so sad that 30+ years of my life undiagnosed could of been so different. üò≠"

Some people get started on ADHD meds on the basis of a substandard assessment and then the next clinician can‚Äôt continue meds (they are legally required to be able to validate the diagnosis before prescribing). I‚Äôd ask them for the basis of their opinion and how they are sure you don‚Äôt meet the diagnostic requirements. Often it‚Äôs due to a lack of evidence of childhood symptoms or a lack of impairment. There are lots of people diagnosed with ADHD who don‚Äôt meet the threshold for the diagnosis, if they then continue the meds and end up with an issue (e.g heart problem or psychosis) then the doctor will be liable. Really sorry to hear about your experience though, sounds very distressing. I‚Äôd try an open dialogue with the doc."

Most doctors can and will continue prescribing the medications their previous doctors did. \n\nHowever, because the ADHD stimulant medications are highly controlled substances with the potential for misuse, they are regulated much more heavily, and any new psychiatrist can require that you are reassessed for ADHD by them before they will prescribe stimulants like Ritilan/ methylphenidate. This is usually done because the psychiatrist needs to justify their prescription of such a highly controlled medication, which is very popular recreationally, to the National body that needs to approve highly controlled medications and their dosage each time a prescription is given to the patient. The doctor has to ring a hotline to get an authority number each time, or the pharmacy cannot fill the prescription.\n\nFortunately it doesn‚Äôt take very long, only a minute at most, and it‚Äôs part of your appointment time, so it‚Äôs not a big deal. And we can get up to 6 months of prescriptions at a time, so 1 initial dosage with up to 5 repeats, so it‚Äôs not like the doctor has to call up every month like they would in the US. \n\nI personally haven‚Äôt experienced it, but it is possible here that the National medication approval system won‚Äôt give the Authority (and required no.) to a psychiatrist for stimulant medication if it‚Äôs not the same psychiatrist who diagnosed you in the first place. But I‚Äôm still seeing the same one who diagnosed me, so it hasn‚Äôt been an issue for me. I do know of other Australian psychiatrists who wouldn‚Äôt prescribe stimulant medication if they haven‚Äôt done the ADHD assessment themselves. They usually won‚Äôt accept an ADHD diagnosis from a psychologist either (at least for adults. I don‚Äôt know about children and diagnoses done by a psychologist through the school). \n\nI don‚Äôt know if this is because of a requirement of our controlled medications/ medical system, or because the psychiatrist themselves has to diagnose/ confirm ADHD as part of their duty of care and legal responsibility when medicating patients with stimulant medications. It‚Äôs damn annoying for sure, especially when finding a psychiatrist and getting a diagnosis is one of those really hard executive functioning tasks that so many of us struggle with. But that‚Äôs what it takes for us to have access to the helpful medication without them becoming virtually impossible to get, like strong pain medication has become, so I understand it."

Have you actually tried looking at what historical accomplishments, inventions and medical achievements that have been made by white males compared to females?\n\nI don't say discrimination doesn't exist but it is rarely in just one direction, it just all seems about blaming white males and giving them no credit for anything, yes, historically they are to be blamed for some things but also to be credited.\n\nI know that as somebody that has ADHD we face people who don't think it is real or it is some made up condition and as frustrating and annoying as that is, try and look at it from their \"normal\" brains.  Why or how can they understand us when their brains are different from ours?  It isn't their fault.\n\nIn some ways it makes sense for them to not understand.  Why should they have to?  They are never gonna know unless they have a very close family member that they grew up with and understood.\n\n  \nIt is all very well to say those who are different from another should understand each other because we have this or that or we are this or that but shouldn't that work both ways?\n\nAny invisible disease or condition is always going to be difficult to understand, sympathise or empathise with.  It also doesn't help when there are harmful people out there who pretend or feign illnesses or conditions or situations for their own gain.\n\nYou must also know there are incredible gifts with ADHD which again, I didn't realise everybody didn't have.\n\nIf anybody with a \"normal\" brain is reading this, I can't speak for anybody else with ADHD but I really wouldn't wish it on anybody."

When I was a girl, we didn‚Äôt know what we know now. But that education is rooted in sex and gender bias. \n\nI‚Äôm not saying every cis boy/man with ADHD would have been diagnosed as a child without incident, you may be one of the ones that weren‚Äôt, but largely it IS women who are under diagnosed or MISDIAGNOSED because we don‚Äôt fit their boxes - the boxes created around cis male research. \n\nAnd a lot of the time the only time it becomes apparent we were ignored or misdiagnosed is because when we get old enough to have children or hit menopause, our hormonal shifts start showing symptoms more akin to the stereotypes in textbooks."

After a year-and-a-half, my mental state gradually improved to the point I was able to safely ween off the ssri.\n\nI was diagnosed with ADHD in childhood, and since the pandemic I had changed clinics several times and my records got lost in the shuffle. It was one of my behavioral therapists who mentioned to me that adhd was no longer listed in my chart, though I clearly presented signs and symptoms of having it.\n\nSo when I contacted my provider, I dropped the old psyche and requested a new one, preferably a woman (female practitioners tend to be more empathetic towards trans issues and women's issues on general, in my experience), and I was an absolute nervous wreck when I went in unmedicated.\n\nShe had to first convince me to stop talking, that there was no need to try and convince her of the issues I was experiencing. She confirmed my diagnosis with a simple questionaire, and after describing my thoughts and feelings to her, wrote me a prescription for atomoxitine.\n\nOn the one month followup, I was sitting in her office, feet still, hands in my lap, eyes forward. I still exhibited a few symptoms, figeting, etc, but overall I had a focus and poise about me that I did not have off the medication. \n\nHad I walked into her clinic day one like this, poised and focused, it would have been the result of being properly medicated. A quick questionaire would have still confirmed or denied the diagnosis.\n\nYour psyche isn't just clueless, she is negligent. Invalidating patient feelings or diagnoses is never okay. It is your right, as a patient, to request a new referral to see a different in-network psychiatrist."

For the vast majority of people, there is non of the stimulant left in their system 24 hours later when they take their next dose. If stimulant medications like (lys)dexamphetamine or methylphenidate caused withdrawal symptoms, we would all be actively suffering withdrawal symptoms every evening and overnight until we took their meds the next day. You also wouldn‚Äôt have so many doctors recommending medication breaks on weekends, or during school holidays for kids. It‚Äôs vital for children under about 16 to have regular stimulant medication breaks so they can have their normal growth spurts and catch up on stunted growth during the holidays. Stimulants usually inhibit growth in children, and they can end up well below their expected adult height if they don‚Äôt take regular meds breaks. It‚Äôs not needed for adults though, only until you stop growing."

Benzos did almost nothing. \n\nWas diagnosed ADHD as a kid but my parents didn't want me on the meds. Didn't get the opportunity to try them until I was an adult. Literally 2 hours after taking Adderall IR, that rolodex basically stopped spinning. Instead I could much easier choose where it spins to and if I have a negative thought come up, I can move on from it without issue. Went from barely functioning in life to starting a family, buying a home, and working a well paying career for over a decade so far.\n\nTried a few different meds but landed on Vyvanse.

And they also checked the quantity of pills on a case. \nI had absolutely no problem after that."

So even out of date info is likely to provide value, even if it's just to give you a sense of what to look for elsewhere.\n\nI think it would be reasonable to put a big disclaimer at the top, a link to the big disclaimer on each country (in case someone links to a specific country and they don't see the main disclaimer), and then put a revised date, summarized info, and links to sources.

I organized and run our household, keep things tidy and clean.\n\nIt's not perfect, and it doesn't work the same way every day... It depends on a lot of factors like sleep which I still sometimes struggle with.\n\nIt was also hard work to figure out my dose and timings... It was over a year of daily logging, failing, crying, wanting to give up, doubting the meds etc. I'm not going to lie, I went through a serious depressive episode because my meds worked instantly for a month and then they didn't suddenly and I couldn't figure out why for a while. If it wasn't for my partner I wouldn't have stuck with it and did the necessary fine tuning adjustments and show the patience necessary.\n\nIn the it was worth it and improved my life in many many ways and I'll be eternally grateful to both my doctor and my partner.\n\nI'd say give it a go, you only have one chance at life and if you think you can benefit from it, trying it and failing is preferable over not doing it, wondering and regretting.

take a leave of absence, my room was literally constantly full of garbage, i wouldn't do laundry for months, my head would never be quiet and i could not think straight.\n\nand you're right it's not magic, and i still struggle with a lot of these things, meds can't fix everything. but they brought me to a level of baseline functionality that allow me to do at least some of the things i need to do, to fix this stuff.\n\nI remember when I first started concerta it didn't do much. i was prescribed a combination of concerta, strattera, and wellbutrin together. they had completely killed my appetite and didn't really have any positive effects. eventually i was switched to just a larger dose of concerta, and it still didn't really feel like it worked at first. but somehow one day as i was heading to my doctor's appt to tell him that, i realised i wasn't 30 mins late like usual (to my 1hr appt), and as i was talking, i started to realise some of what i was saying didn't feel fully accurate anymore. he left for a minute, and as he came back i told him this, and he said he noticed. he said I've never been so vocal, and i actually look a bit happy, instead of seeming closed up and looking down and rocking and barely getting a word out. he increased my dose a bit, and as i headed back after the appointment i ran into a stranger with her daughter asking for directions. i didn't speak the language, but i gave them some directions and left. a couple mins later i realised I'd given them the wrong directions, and usually, i'd feel guilty about it all day but be frozen to do anything about it in the moment. instead, i just walked back and found them, and walked them 15 mins to their destination with google maps bcs it was hard to explain the way with the language barrier and they didn't have internet.\n\nbefore that day, even getting out of bed, brushing my teeth, eating, showering, everything, just living really, felt like too much effort and not worth it.\n\nas i got home, i had the passing thought that i should call my mom since it'd been weeks since i picked up her calls or texted her, and then i did it. usually, going from thought to action would take hours of agonising and then not actually happen. this time, i just did it. and when i hung up, i was alone in the room, and it just struck me how quiet it felt. no 30 mixed songs playing over each other, 5 random phrases repeating, 20 more thoughts crashing into each other in my head. just so much quieter until i chose to have a thought. i could go from one thought to the next. i honestly almost cried.\n\ni was supposed to talk to my doctor in a week, but i only went back over a month later. he was so worried, but then so shocked at how well i seemed to be doing. he genuinely thought I'd killed myself or something, and was so sad that nothing had worked at this point, but when he saw me, and heard that i actually went on a trip with friends, he was shocked. he was laughing incredulously. he had never expected an improvement like this.\n\ni started doing a lot better at uni as well, it was unfortunately too little too late, and my enrollment eventually ended up getting terminated. but i found a different uni doing a different program, actually got in, and love it so much. im doing so much better here. i am still sometimes late and sometimes miss classes and I'm also not super consistent with meds, but I'm actually doing so well. straight As, finally getting my work done on time, not missing so many classes that i fail classes for absences even if i do still miss some days.\n\ni still have bad times sometimes. my room is a garbage dump again, i still struggle to do laundry often sometimes, I'm social but not super social, I'm not very physically healthy, but I can actually see a path forward where these things will also get better. for the first summer ever i will have finished all my assignments by the end of the semester, no extensions that hang over my head the whole summer. i will finally clean and organise my room and then try to keep it that way. i will have a regular schedule next semester even if i don't have class at the same time everyday, take my meds more consistently, cook more often instead of ordering takeout so much and wasting money, try to get more freelance work (which I've already been doing some which is a crazy thought considering where i was before), start going the the gym, and make more social plans myself, and the thing is i can actually see myself doing these things now. and a lot of this has to do with meds. living with friends is a big part of it as well, but the meds also enabled me to participate in life more and engage with my roommates and get closer to friends and so on. honestly for me they did so much, and it's not the same for everyone, but for some people and those who are really not managing to even survive, they can be a lifesaver."

They definitely helped with all aspects of life, or rather my ADHD was indeed affecting all of the categories you mention:\n\n- My career improved, I struggle less with \"unpleasant\" tasks and I'm more organized in general, which directly translates to better results and honestly just plain more enjoyment of work because I'm actually good at what I do\n\n- Relationships improved because I stopped being constantly burnt out, and had more energy/motivation/time to actually devote to my partner and family\n\n- Motivation, well, it's not a night/day difference, but it's there. It's like a +25% on whether I successfully get off my ass and do stuff I aim to do, which depending on your perspective can be life changing nonetheless.\n\n- Mental health & confidence - oh yes. I realized over time I stopped being so constantly self-doubting, and instead became a lot more \"natural\" when dealing with people.\n\n- Financial stability - kinda? Maybe more so bureaucratic stuff, like filling out my taxes, taking my car to the mechanic, etc. Health not so much, still working on that one haha, I *will* one day start working out, I'm sure.\n\nI'm not a different person, and it's not like my problems were erased, but it's a big difference still.

My life hasn't significantly changed yet, but there's definitely some subtle improvements that I'm sure gonna have a positive effect in the long run, mainly the fact that now when I'm stressed out about stuff, I just do something about it, even if it means working on something over a long course of time. Before meds I was always stressed out about problems that would likely arrise in the future, but couldn't get myself to do anything about it and just did stuff to escape from my worries instead. As a result, I feel less useless now and I'm starting to believe in myself again. I feel like whatever happens, I'll be able to deal with it, while before taking  meds, I was in a constant state of being overwhelmed by every possible problem that I might have to deal with someday, and because of avoiding discomfort instead of dealing with anything, it just kept building up. I still have a long way to go to get my life back on track after avoiding dealing with problems all my life, but, I'm getting there slowly but surely."

    "comment": "Audhd'er here. When I started taking medication, I was blown away by the immediate improvement in my ability to focus, and do tasks that normally I just couldn't make myself do. I have far less anxiety. I have far better emotional regulation. I probably wouldn't have my current relationship without it.  My head doesn't race all night. I don't have a kazililion thoughts going at the one time. I don't have repeating intrusive phrases going in my mind.\n\nIf I was in a career that I wanted to be in, I think I'd get a lot more benefits from the medication and would be smashing life right now. I wish I had the medication back when I was doing something that meant a lot to me, but that was a long time ago. I'm looking for another job. Currently I can still only work part time and not become dysregulated and depressed. That has a significant financial cost. I recently had a couple of weeks off work and the surge in my emotional wellbeing and cognitive ability was mind blowing.  I know that if I was doing my own (creative) work that my wellbeing would greatly improve as I tend to have a vast amount of energy for my own work. Anyhow, I'm working on that.\n\nBecause the impact of medication on my mental health and focus was so great, I did expect it to bring a massive turnaround in my life as I've always been ambitious, driven and for the right project, very hard working.  I anticipated a sudden upswing in success etc. But I got diagnosed so late, many of my great lifetime opportunities have been well and truly lost years ago and there's not really a way back into those fields for me now. And I think I've grieved them and moved on.  I now find that I have to put financial security above everything as I'm at an age now where a big risk could wipe me out, without time to catch up. I do feel like my parachute has opened pretty fucking late. I could easily hit the ground anyway. That being said, I'm still looking at how I can pursue something meaningful and satisfying again now.\n\nTwo years in, I can see that I need to take a job that is a lot simpler. I get turned down for many jobs for being overqualified or coming across as too knowledgeable or too intellectual for the job. I usually cut most of my CV out to get jobs. I'm hoping to get a receptionist job, for my mental health and happiness. I have an irrefutable ceiling on some abilities. Time to accept it.\n\nSince medication I've spent a lot of time working on getting my house in order.  My house has gone from messy and not very clean, to immaculate and minimalist. I still have some junk to get rid of that's in storage. There is still a fair bit of financial neglect to rectify. Tax stuff. I'm still very financially insecure and am still floating around being very bright, hard working and determined, but in the wroooong place. My peers are now almost ready to retire. Most are wealthy or at least very well off and have done the things they wanted to do. None of us grew up wealthy but everyone has done very well. I have a very small window of years now to create financial security for myself. I'll give it a red hot go. I work a lot on radical self acceptance, meditation etc. and try not to freak the fuck out.\n\nI've developed a tolerance for vyvanse and am experimenting with an increased dosage. I think I need to take 50% more now. I'm not sure what happens if/when I become even more tolerant of it. Hopefully it'll be ok. \n\nEdit: I think if I can wangle my way into a creative situation, I think there's still a good chance of achieving some of the things I've wanted to."

Such dramatic improvement that I can‚Äôt believe I went 26 years of my life undiagnosed. The biggest impact my adhd has on me is my ability to emotionally regulate, forgetfulness, and impulsivity. Like I would forget what I was saying mid sentence, my mind would go blank from anxiety, and any perceived negative reaction made me extremely upset with myself and ugh it was awful. With meds, my extreme anxiety and impulsivity is basically non existent so now I can‚Äôt actually function like a normal human and not worry/freak out/have a breakdown over everything, and I don‚Äôt have the brain fog that kept me from constantly forgetting what I was saying mid sentence..Which of course has dramatically improved my relationships and my ability to make and keep friends\n\n- motivation & achieving goals: it doesn‚Äôt do much for me in this realm because I‚Äôm normally a very ambitious person and try to see things through the end, but I‚Äôd say that meds help me keep a clear mind so I can sit down, plan out my day & time spent on things, and focus on whatever I‚Äôm doing without distraction. I‚Äôd say my goals are achieved a bit quicker now.\n\n- mental health/confidence/anxiety. It‚Äôs been absolutely life changing and I‚Äôm absolutely mot the same person I was a year ago. I‚Äôm much more confident because I‚Äôm not ruminating or anxious about everything 24/7, I can ground myself much easier now, and mental health has improved but I still need to make sure I‚Äôm keeping all the systems i built up over the years to keep my mental health in check. I‚Äôd say mental health is still a daily struggle but it‚Äôs nowhere near as bad & it‚Äôs much more manageable since I have an easier time keeping my emotions regulated\n\n- financial stability: I‚Äôm not impulse shopping anymore :) I had a really really bad shopping addiction, like I was still buying random shit even though I didn‚Äôt really fully want it, I just wanted the high that came with getting something new for myself. Unfortunately I‚Äôm working 2 jobs now to fix my finances from my spending addiction, but I‚Äôll take this + being medicated over being unmedicated and very impulsive any day of the week"

Ive started taking it two times in the morning and one in the afternoon but to get the consistent affect has been a chellenge. To me it's about timing and what I've eaten and how well im hydrated. I make sure to eat a pretty good meal before taking Adderall. In the morning im assuming i still have the seroquil in my system so it might be waking me up From that. Also what Ive experienced it helps to be very hydrated. Ive been taking amino acid and electrolytes powder with chia seeds mixed in water and its made a difference.

    "comment": "**Did your life change significantly before vs after meds?**\n\nYes, profoundly, in my opinion. After about 6 months or so, I actually realized what being medicated was doing for me.\n\nDid they help with things like:\n\n**Career or school success**: I started actually doing work instead of sitting around all the damn time. *Everyone* noticed this. I was a manager, so I was \"managing\" but I could never find it in me to jump in and help if it wasn't *absolutely necessary*. Suddenly, I was jumping in, helping out, learning new things and expanding my knowledge at work. It really helped me become liked by the employees rather than hated.\n\n**Relationships or marriage**: My girlfriend is happy that I have been able to *mostly* stick to routines and my room has actually been kept clean for over a year now. I can do chores more easily, although I still have my bad days where my meds don't fully activate or I'm not doing well mentally because of my job. But I would usually have a cycle where my room would pile up and get junky and then several months later, I'd finally clean it. Rinse and repeat. But now, I'm taking my trash out as soon as the trash can fills up and not letting several bags pile up, doing my laundry every 3-5 days instead of once every two or three weeks when I ran out of clean clothes, and I'm keeping the floor clean and clear of clutter.\n\n**Motivation and achieving goals**: Still have trouble with motivation, doesn't seem to have done much for this aspect if we're viewing this as motivation to achieve goals. I do have more motivation in general to just do *things*. Within the first three months of me taking Adderall/Ritalin, I got promoted to General Manager, and before I had started taking it, I would have never even been on a top 25 list to get promoted. Take that as you will.\n\n**Mental health, confidence, or anxiety**: I've discovered that my mental health revolves around how well I am doing at work. I don't think my Adderall does anything to help with this at all. For confidence and anxiety, I noticed a marked improvement in my social anxiety after starting guanfacine. Although, I did start doing weekly therapy with a new therapist late last year and I started the guanfacine at the same time, so I don't know if it's the meds or if its the therapy.\n\n**Even financial stability or health?** I've actually started focusing more on my health recently and because of Adderall, I can more easily overcome that executive dysfunction of having to set up appointments or call, or even go to appointments the day of. It's led to me getting a diagnosis of narcolepsy, actually going to therapy to get help, a colonoscopy that I was 6+ years overdue for, and being able to mostly keep routines is helping me with all of that as well. Financial stability? I'm not entirely certain I can thank Adderall for that. I started Zepbound last year and it has helped me not spend $1000s on DoorDash or eating out at restaurants.\n\nIt's been a net positive in my life and I am so glad that I didn't have to jump through hoops to get prescribed. I understand my \"diagnosis\" was odd and my doctor seems very \"pill happy\", but I got like 30mg of Adderall as my starting dose after just a 5 minute conversation with my psychiatrist who I had literally just met. I'm not a huge fan of him anymore because my follow ups are about 2-3 minutes over telehealth and he just asks, \"How's the Adderall doing? Okay, great, I'm sending 3 months to your pharmacy, see ya later!\" I think I timed one of my appointments at 1 minute 57 seconds. I plan on switching to a new psychiatrist because I'd like to have one that I can talk to about my ADHD and not about my ADHD meds, if that makes any sense. I still have zero idea as to the nature of my ADHD, what type it is, how it actually affects me in my daily life, or anything like that. I've had to do my own research about ADHD and I'm also afraid that since I don't even have an ADHD assessment, that it could eventually prevent me from getting my meds in the future.\n\nIf I were to pinpoint any negatives about my ADHD meds, it's that it can definitely lead to impulsivity in a negative way. Before, I'd have executive dysfunction and I wouldn't be able to make myself do something. But now, I can open that Amazon tab and order that thing that I don't need. I also take T for low testosterone which increases my sex drive and I think my ADHD meds allow me to indulge in that a lot more than I would have. Before I'd be horny and *think* about masturbating, but I wouldn't ever end up doing it. Now it's like I think about it and I do it - and I've probably done it more in the past year than the previous 2-3 years combined. I also sometimes feel like I rely too much on needing the Adderall to be able to do things. I know I'm not supposed to, but I would sometimes take extra if something important was happening (such as the big boss is doing a visit at work) or if I was tired because I didn't get any sleep. Even with this, though, I will sometimes forget to even take it after my first dose. After I get to work, I just go into work mode and forget that I have Adderall with me to take throughout the day. A lot of the time, I only end up taking 1 out of the 3 daily pills that I'm supposed to take.\n\nFinally, it actually helps me sleep better and more consistently. I fall asleep faster than I ever have before because I no longer have anxiety over feeling tired the next day. Adderall would take away any tiredness that I had, so I no longer had to worry about feeling like complete shit all day if I didn't get sleep. So taking away my anxiety over \"I have to sleep, I need to get to sleep, AAAAAA\" actually improved my sleep.\n\n**TL;DR: Yes. Adderall has changed my life and I am so happy that I was able to get prescribed this medication.**"

When I originally went to university, before deploying, I had a very difficult time focusing on things which I needed to do both academically and practically. My grades were excellent for courses I had an interest in, and passable (or terrible) for the ones I did not.\n\nAfter I got diagnosed and received medication during my final semester, it was a completely new story. I had a drive to do things which had previously eluded me and had a perfect semester GPA and made honor roll lol. My professors had all noticed a change, and one of them encouraged me to continue studying for a Master's degree. I ended up moving to Europe a year or so later, and fear of starting the medication process in a different country after the nightmare that was the American healthcare system left me unmedicated for a little over 2 years.\n\nIn that time, I've dealt with instability, inability to do things I \\*know\\* I can do and have the capacity for, and have grappled with a lot of other underlying issues both mental and physical. It's been grueling to be without the support medication provided me, especially because I \\*remembered\\* what I was missing. I just started it again this last month, and found it was wildly blown out of proportion in my mind in terms of how much effort needed to be made (and money spent) in contrast to in the U.S.\n\nI'm unsure what else will change going forward, but I do know medication will be very critical for me in the long-run."

I was tested the summer after year one in college and had ADHD. I was taught couping skills and put on XR adderall and I can say it changed everything. BUT I do feel it waa a combination of both. My basic life skills improved as well. I was no longer late and having issues getting up early and forgetting things I had scheduled.

I would go from wanting to cry to raging for small reasons and now I'm very even with my emotions and just more relaxed and able to let little things go without blowing things out of proportion.\nIt's been a game changer and I wished I had gotten assessed sooner I had no idea life could be this good.

My mood is more settled and my emotions are more regulated though I still have had some spirals. I am more motviated but only for hands on practical tasks like cleaning so far, not for anything that involves sitting still and focusing, like paperwork at work, unfortunately. My mind isn't quiet and I cant focus on one thing either. Other people have commented that i seem calmer, quieter and more present even before i noticed it.

Although my brain is as are as IQ numbers, very high. But, I did not make it past 10th grade. Basically. I am an autodiotiac and mainly learn visually. \n\nI was glad the newer medications of recent years/decades helped my brain focus and become more productive, I was sad for a while about the years of confusion and harsh effects of the psychotropics but that is history now. Back then, in my early teens, first-generation psychotropic medicines were what was prescribed. Also, there are a few stats in psychiatric wards for observation and rx regulating. It was Hell. \n\nI try hard to monitor the side effects of adderall and am not always successful. I just forget that sometimes it's absolutely necessary, especially at my age. After cancer at 41, my body was forced into early menopause which created other problems, but fortunately, they were helped with bioidentical hormone pellets. My life has been night and day since these adhd meds, and I am grateful. It is worth the meds to live a fuller \"my life.\"\n\nMy son was thankfully diagnosed in his  early 20s. He has been able to have a very successful long-time career in IT. For this alone, I am very grateful for those diagnosed early and medicated properly. \n\nHowever, everyone is different and unique. So, what fits for one may not be for others. It's best if you can find a compationate MD or, in my case, a DO.\n\nJust because one pill feels great does not mean that without a physician's supervision, it is not a wise thing to do by yourself. For some, like my son, half of a 20 mg is good for the entire day, for others dosage is more/less. \n\nTry to avoid other excessive stimulation via drinks, etc. To get a true reading on any changes and/or side effects that could affect blood pressure, etc. \n\nI wish you success, clarity and peace of mind going forward."

Takes an hour to kick in, and energy/\"get up and go\" feeling lasts about two hours. The last hour I start slowing down and get tired and drowsy, sometimes dizzy or a headache. After I take my second dose, the sick feeling fades and I can keep going, not with as much energy as the first dose, but enough. If I take it more than an hour late, I'm up all night.\n\nI notice I get annoyed/angry/irritated/overwhelmed episodes once or twice in two weeks on average, and \"motormouth, running on an engine\" episodes where I'm go, go, go: not able to sit still and begging to go different places for shopping or food all the while yapping and barely able to wait for anything.\n\nI was on Adderall before, and that one had me like a windup toy doing tasks nonstop, except it was usually on something random.

I couldn't keep a full time job, manage my finances or relationships. which is why I had to figure my shit out. I'm also on the spectrum. Disordered thinking, emotional dysregulation, inattentiveness and impulsivity are my most dominant traits. My short-term memory is the shittiest.  \nI resisted medication because I thought I could figure how to cope with it on my own. My therapist convinced to just try and if it didn't work for me, no harm done. It gave me the relief and clarity I needed to do the work. I'm very lucky, I didn't have to try multiple medications, we figured out my correct dosage in about 6 months, and the side effects are manageable. I was able to reduce my mood disorder medication, my anxiety was greatly reduced, I just felt better. It's been years now. The combination of therapy, ADHD coaching, and medication has allowed me to finally achieve some dreams I once thought were impossible.   \nEven with interventions, there are moments when I have a brain glitch every day, but I can catch them now and refocus. My mood regulation is better, way fewer meltdowns. A mistake is no longer world shattering, sending me down into a self-destructive shame spiral. It still sucks but my perspective has changed now that I'm not so jumbled up. I stopped masking with friends and family and some coworkers. Turns out that I'm actually funny and nice. Who knew?  \nI came out to my bosses when I pursued a promotion last year because I felt they should know that the training process and future workflow was going to have to include accomodations. I never would have done that without all the previous successes behind me. Of course, they already knew, lol, but they were able to involve HR and make it all official. I never thought I would get the job but they saw how much my work and my relationships with co-workers had improved over the last few years. ADHD coaching was vital and my insurance covered some of the cost. I wish I could afford more. Some day.    \nMedication isn't magic. Maintaining my stability, like everything in life, requires effort. I will take this medication for the rest of my life, just like someone with diabetes takes insulin.

I was definitely more productive when I was obsessively masking and trying my hardest. I was also more exhausted.\n\nI think I turned a corner perspective-wise as well‚Äîso again, nothing happens in a vacuum. I live a more relaxed and less stressed life now, but also in large part because I no longer try to go at everyone else‚Äôs pace.\n\nI can‚Äôt know how things would‚Äôve turned out if I had kept going it alone without help.

I don't feel I'm being pulled in a thousand directions at the same time anymore.\n- Work is tolerable, and I find it easier to start tasks and commit to them. \n- I'm way more aware of time. Days now seem consistent in length, and I can better estimate tasks. I can easily be on time for everything, and rarely get stuck in waiting mode. \n- I'm capable of better managing relationships, making plans and taking a genuine interest in people, and have more energy for socialising, I'm less in edge, and my  social Life has been getting increasingly fulfilling.\n\nNotes: it wasn't a straightforward process. I had to find my dosage, and I had to deal with secondary effects. My body became more adjusted to it eventually, though. And my habits started to better support it. Every person is different, but I find that the benefits of meds are greatly improved and the side effects greatly mitigated by: \n- regularly sleeping at least 8 hours.\n- keeping up with hydration.\n- eating enough protein (particularly for breakfast with the meds), and eating healthy in general.\n- exercising.\n- I also take magnesium supplements, and it seems to help me prevent muscle and joint pain, which was the main problem I had with the meds at the start."

I can‚Äôt focus better, can‚Äôt remember more, can‚Äôt stay in task, can‚Äôt do anything better than I did before the meds.

So, I'm also gonna go over how those have helped as well, just to paint a better picture. \n\nMy lexapro has helped with my MDD a lot. I don't get depressed, my moods are more stable, and I'm able to enjoy life.\n\nMy trazadone (or however you spell it) has improved my sleep SO much. I'm able to fall asleep quickly, stay asleep longer; and if I do wake up, I'm able to go back to sleep easier. \n\nMy abilify have made my anxiety go from a 15/10 (daily) to a 7/10. It's made me less anxious all around. From my general anxiety to my social anxiety and even just normal anxiety. \n\nMy Buspar has made that 7/10 to a 5/10. It's also helped with my overall anxiety, but mainly my social anxiety and the paranoia that I seemed to have developed from having untreated anxiety for about 60-70% of my life. \n\nMy testosterone, while not intended for my moods, has helped me be overall more happy, too. T had helped me in so many ways that I couldn't leave it out. Of course, it's helped me in my transition, but, again, it's helped with my moods, my self-image, and just my overall look on life. \n\nThis got a bit long, but I figured since we were talking about meds, it would be good to include the others I take that help with my moods and other things I experience."

In my opinion, truly life changing.\n\nI take 25mg xr in the morning and 20mg IR in the afternoon.\n\nPhysically, I'm no longer tired and dragging all the time. It used to eel like I was physically walking through water or mud all the time and moving my body was just tiring. Now I feel like I did when I was a kid and actually have energy, which makes it easier for me to get up and do stuff or makes me excited to get out of the house, rather than needing to stay home and recharge so often.\n\nI found out that I'm really good at my job! I'm a special Ed teacher, and now I feel way more engaged with my students. I don't feel the need to sit down all the time. I put so much more time into thoughtful lessons and getting my paperwork done on time is SO MUCH EASIER. I still struggle sometimes with completing all paperwork and small stuff, bit it's overall way better.  I also feel much more confident at my job. Like, I know that I'm a really good teacher and I can see it and feel it, and I get really good feedback from admin.\n\nSometimes it's still hard to start tasks, but once I do I'm able to stick with it for much longer. My task and focus stamina has inxreqsed significantly and I feel like I can hyper fixate on things thst, in thr past, I would have struggled to do at all.\n\nDoing chores rewards my brain (but only when my meds are actively working). I feel satisfaction now from doing dishes or cleaning. Before it was such an unfulfilling task that brought no satisfaction or reward and felt like torture. I now have more pride in cleanliness and keeping up with things.\n\nI didn't realize i had anxiety before I took meds. I used to feel extreme stress and disappointment in myself for dropping the ball for something at work, or not doing really important things. Every week I'd have multiple events where I'd feel really anxious and it would make me feel irrationally angry and depressed and stressed. But in the 5 years since starting my meds, I have only experienced anxiety like 2 or 3 times.\n\nBut of course things aren't perfect. I still struggle to get motivated, complete tasks, and to do less preferred tasks. This affects my relationship a lot. My wife doesn't trust me to finish or do things that I say I will do. And I feel awful for it and I hate how I disappoint her and sometimes I feel like I'm going to lose her because of it, but I dont know what to do. But I'm still in a better position than I was before because I recognize those challenges and I truly want to make positive changes to be better for us as a family."

I grew up in a home where there was a mix of folk of varying abilities (seriously it‚Äôs harder to type this story when you limit my verbiage of descriptors). I thought I was normal. So when I learned that I wasn‚Äôt, I was able to understand why my children were struggling so much more than I did. I had a mother that could regulate her emotions and learned to imitate her. My children were learning to imitate my imitations. When I understood this, I immediately took action to get my children more resources and became much more understanding of their struggles and how to tackle them.\n\nWith my husband, he had ADHD. I was unfairly judging him in ways that I had been taught to judge. I also couldn‚Äôt understand why my family saw him as a bad person, and why they would not change their opinion of him. When I started researching what it meant to have ADHD, I was able to understand a lot of the nuance behind my family‚Äôs very unfair judgements, and was able to shed the last of my own internalized opinions on those judgements.¬†\n\nTheir judgements had always been levied against me as well. I had grown up very withdrawn and oppressed. The longer I lived with my husband, the more I discovered my true self, and the more my family grew to despise me as well. He was a bad influence on me. They never said it to my face, but it was implied. My diagnosis and discovery of what that meant freed me from decades of pain I never knew I had. It was the last push I needed to drop the shackles holding me back.\n\nI was never an anxious person. But I never really knew myself. My confidence has been growing since my marriage, but it‚Äôs at an all time high now that I have answers I never knew I needed.\n\nI have been healing in emotional ways too. I‚Äôm less angry, less judgmental, less frustrated, more playful. I feel more like myself. Like discovering a long last friend I thought I‚Äôd never see again."

I had a very valuable and prestigious education, that I barely made it through, but couldn‚Äôt really put it to use.  I would describe myself to others as lazy.  My parents considered me a constant source of disappointment.  \n\nAfter being unemployed during the GFC for 18 months, I finally landed a job and got engaged. I was almost 30 and I knew I had to change something. The job was too good to fuck up and I didn‚Äôt want to be unemployed again and unable to contribute to my family.  So I went on Adderall XR.  \n\nIt was like a switch flipped.  I realized pretty quickly that I could do boring repetitive tasks I usually avoided and I could stay organized and stop losing stuff. I started enjoying my work. I did so well in my new job, I stayed with the company for 12 years. It was one of the top companies in my industry and I became one of their most valuable employees.  One year I negotiated a 20% raise(really).  Instead of being bored I just grabbed every opportunity and ran with it.  It really felt like I was finally doing the quality of work of which I was capable.  I turned that into another job at a top tier place and now I have my own small consulting business.  I never thought I‚Äôd be able to work for myself, but here we are. \n\nIt helped me address so many other personal  problems too. When I saw that I could be successful at work, I started taking on stuff I avoided. I fixed my credit.  I got out of debt.  I started really saving for retirement. My wife and I were able to move to a nicer apartment.  I started exercising regularly(that one is still tough but I‚Äôve mostly stuck to it).I am in the process of getting my teeth fixed after avoiding the dentist for years and years.

My professor spoke to me about it and gave me a second chance that I asked him for; he let me bring a pen up to the stand with me to play with; I let myself study and practice (and, god, I had the patience to practice; I had the patience to let myself try to retry without beating myself up so harshly over it); and I sat down at the stand, stated my name and university, and it was like everything... melted. It was perfect. I went over my time, but I knew everything I was talking about, and I got a near perfect score.¬†\n\n\nIn years past, I would have just taken a failing grade and said little to no words for the remainder of the semester. I wouldn't have gone to our celebratory hockey game, either. And I did. For the first time in my life, I was out of my head enough to let myself try-- and to let myself enjoy things. I was calm enough to focus on my quant labs and let someone else talk while I searched for components of gasoline; I was calm enough to get through my family's horrible, arrest-laden Christmas; I was okay, for the first time in my life. It wasn't a breeze, but it was easy. For the first time, I knew I was as smart as everyone said I was. I was mature, my Meemaw told me (in a random Publix parking lot? Right before we found out someone got arrested? Crazy. Wild).¬†\n\n\nIt's not like it was a cure all. I'm still me. I'm still an anxious mess. I still find myself defaulting to things like \"Oh, he hates me\" when literally anything happens-- but it's so much easier to push it aside. It's easier to keep up on friendships, on work, on my family relationships. It's easier to find a place in new parts of my family. And I have a job! I got promoted! It's not in my field, but I use the skills I got from my degree all the time, and I know my limits, and I know I'm capable! I can feel the difference, being on them versus being off. I can run things. I'm large and in charge, man. I don't think I coukd have done it before. Or, if I had, it would have been so. Much. Harder."

    "comment": "I've been put on many things for ADHD since I was 5 years old. The ones I actually remember are Concerta and Strattera. I took Concerta from ages 8 to 20, but around 16 I started \"not taking\" them and throwing them in the trash and just not taking them at all during the summer (which I convinced my parents to let me do). I honestly never noticed any effect. I could stop taking it cold turkey and nothing would happen. I was no different with or without it. My parents switched me to strattera when I was 15 and it made me extremely depressed in a harmful way, so that didn't last long. \n\nA couple of years ago I decided to try Vyvanse. I did some research on it and thought it could be helpful. I decided to start taking meds again because I just felt off. Having been on it for the past couple of years, it has made my world way more clear and colorful.\n\n\\- In terms of career and school, I have had the same job for almost two years now and I decided to go back to school. I'm still finding challenges with returning to school, but I'm hopeful once I work out the kinks and get back into a normal routine, I'll do better.\n\n\\- In terms of relationship or marriage there has been no effect. My BPD makes sure of that. \n\n\\- In terms of motivation and achieving goals, I actually want to complete things. I don't always wait until the last minute, but when I do I get everything done and I make sure it's done well. I have been doing good at setting up boundaries for myself and making sure the goals I'm setting are for me and no one else. Like I want to go back to school for me, not my parents. \n\n\\- In terms of mental health/confidence/anxiety, I fear that cannot be fixed with ADHD medication. I've got a few comorbidities. So any effect my medication could have on those things, I would never feel or notice.\n\n\\- In terms of financial stability, I have credit cards again and I've been working hard to make sure they are paid off or paid on time instead of letting them go to collections like I've done in the past. I actively try to save money and create tools to help me do so. \n\nIn terms of health, I've lost 30 or so pounds? But that is most likely due to the Vyvanse helping to  control my compulsive eating/binge-eating, which was one of the deciding factors on taking Vyvanse. I drink way more water, but my eating habits have honestly not changed much- I just eat a normal amount now. \n\nI noticed positive changes most significantly a year into taking Vyvanse and they have been steadily keeping course."

But the way I see it is I have a 50/50 chance sometimes of me just doing the task as soon as it comes to mind, rather then procrastinating on it and getting stuck for 2 hours going in circles in my head, \nAnd if I‚Äôm doing half the things I need to do as well as better choices throughout the rest of my life it will compound pretty well. \nHave been sober for 3 years now. 2 years was without medication as I developed a pretty severe case of pancreatitis and was forced to quit drinking. \nBut the year of medication has helped me develop new coping skills, like going for a ride or to the gym. \nFor reference I Did 6 months on Concerta, \nWorked pretty well for me but I switched to Vyvanse as I heard it worked better for some, so I wanted to not leave any eggs in the basket so to speak, Vyvanse seems to work a little better for me, I also quit drinking caffeine as I noticed it was effecting the medication, as I‚Äôd drink too many throughout the day.\nSometimes I‚Äôd get imposter syndrome and think is it working etc, but then I look back on the past 12 months and the physical and mental shift has been huge. All the little things compound, it helps a lot but you have to point it all in the right direction. The first few months medicated I was just playing games etc, but that wasn‚Äôt a path I wanted to stay on.\nAlways wanted to get healthier for myself and my family so that has been my priority."

I'm worried if I'll be able go sustain my marriage or even be able to hold down a long term job, which i want to do but feel no motivation in my life. My only income is through the VA thankfully, but that's not enough to live on really. I just started taking amoexitine 40mg for two weeks and now moved up to 40mg twice a day. I have my doubts, but I'll try it. I don't like that it takes months to start working, my life is falling apart now! But it seems like it's always going to be to psychiatrists first diagnosis to prescribe non-stimulant medication. I have my seizures totally under control, and I don't have reactions to stimulants but which is what's annoying because I feel like I can't tell that to the psychiatrist or else they will just think I'm trying to get stimulant medicine. So hopefully I got it all wrong but I just don't feel the medicine working the way I need it to in the right way it should be for me. I might be wrong, time will tell over the next month while I take the new dosage.¬†\n\n\nIf anyone is out there who has any experience dealing with VA psychiatrists with adult ADHD I would really appreciate their input. The VA is great, but it's kinda difficult to find the right words to say especially in these situations when talking to the psychiatrist. Thank You"

I don't *feel* a difference as much as I DONT feel all the obstacles in my brain that I have to overcome before I can start to do anything. I was a biggest procrastinator and avoider, often relying on deadlines to be my motivation to do tasks i hated. But now, often, I think \"I should take those curtains down and wash them\" and the next thing I know I'm DOING it. It would seem completely normal except that I KNOW that it's not.\n\n\n¬† It would take me HOURS to get myself going in the morning unless I HAD to be there and til lunch for my brain to fully wake up. Now I'm still not a morning person but I can now actually accomplish something in the a.m.\n\nThe endless planning in my brain has quieted tremendously. It's still my habit but now when I catch myself at it I can redirect my thoughts! It's so much less exhausting that I can't believe people have lived like this their entire lives. It's crazy.\n\nOh and maybe the biggest difference is in the rage/disproportionate reactions OR lack thereof I should say! Someone flipped me off after stopping mid-lane in traffic one of the first days on it and I thought \"wow that was inconsiderate!\" And all but forgot about it. It was a NON issue. Before I'd have been very pissed, would've felt the need to scream back at them (instead of quietly returning the bird) and brooded over it.¬†\n\nI just started working out again..and once again I cant get over the lack of negative chatter in my brain. Fighting that off mentally was honestly the worst part of exercising¬† and I didnt realize that it was from ADHD --until¬† I started running and biking again and wondering why it seemed so much easier this time. I really think it's the lack of crazy-brain. No wonder people can run and bike and all that and not loathe it!¬†\n\nSo that's my experience. I'm 100% on board."

    "comment": "Since starting ADHD medication, I‚Äôve seen major improvements across the board.\n\nCareer or school success\nWork has improved noticeably. Before meds, I constantly second-guessed myself. I‚Äôd doubt my understanding of legislation and worry about making mistakes. Since medicating, the quality of my work has gone up significantly. At first, my output dropped because I had more mental bandwidth but no clear direction. Once I re-established my routines, everything clicked. I‚Äôve applied for a promotion, and for the first time I‚Äôm not overwhelmed by stress leading up to an interview.\n\nRelationships or marriage\nOne of the main reasons I sought medication was my wife. She carries a huge load as our main income earner and the one who kept everything running. I could see the weight she carried and worried she‚Äôd end up resenting me. Since starting meds, I‚Äôve been able to step up more. She can finally take time off and actually relax. Our relationship was strong before, but it‚Äôs now the best it‚Äôs ever been.\n\nMotivation and achieving goals\nThe biggest shift has been clarity. I can start something, put it down, and come back to it. Medium and long-term goals no longer feel impossible. I‚Äôve been able to create systems and follow through.\n\nFinancial stability\nImpulsivity has dropped massively. I‚Äôm not making random purchases or chasing food cravings. That‚Äôs made a big difference in terms of money management and general self-control.\n\nHealth\nI was on a high dose of blood pressure medication and still getting 150‚Äì165 over 75‚Äì95. Within three weeks of starting ADHD treatment, I began experiencing low blood pressure. After working with my GP, my meds were reduced, and now I‚Äôm close to coming off them completely. My readings are sitting between 115‚Äì125 over 60‚Äì70. It‚Äôs a huge shift.\n\nMental clarity\nI don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúsmarter,‚Äù but I feel like the noise has been removed. I can think clearly, focus, and follow a line of reasoning without getting derailed.\n\nLifestyle\nI‚Äôm well past the euphoric stage. The real benefits came after that, when I used the boost from the meds to make real lifestyle changes. I‚Äôve improved my sleep, get regular sunlight and exercise, eat better, and stick to routines. The medication helped me build those habits, and in turn, those habits are making the medication work even better."

In my late seventies, I was still taking the one that worked, but as I aged, I lacked energy more and more. In my mid-seventies I faced some extremely depressing and exhausting problems I had to solve and had no one to help me. My depression was bad but manageable. The same antidepressant continued to make \"normal\" life livable, but less enjoyable.  The worst part was that I simply ran out of energy.  I mean OUT of energy.  My doctor prescribed a generic Adderall along with my antidepressant. I had absolutely no confidence whatsoever that it would work.  Finding the one antidepressant that worked was the result of so many trials and failures over so many years that I assumed Adderall would be a failure.  The first night, I swallowed one Adderall  without even thinking about it, not expecting anything. I took it mechanically, without expectations. The next morning, I sat up in bed and immediately noticed that I felt entirely different!  I instantly knew I was well.  It has been well over a year.  I can now cope with difficult situations and problems 99% better than ever before. Not one day has been extremely bad.  I will never forget the feeling I instantly had when I sat up in bed that first day."

    "comment": "When do you take the pill and when does fatigue set in? If it is at the end of the day, just accept it as part of your day... it can feel jarring because it is sudden and harsh, but it is just tiredness.\n\nIf it is stronger and you have rebound effects, maybe try taking a smaller dose towards the end of the day, like a 5mg immediate release or a 10mg long release dose.. that's what I do.\n\nMy current schedule is: 35mg in the morning with breakfast and 30mg with lunch. I take mine with food, to have a more even release profile.\n\nHere's how I figured out my dose step by step:\n\nFirst figure out the right first dose.. My doctor increased my dose by 10mg every week until we figured out if it was too much. At around 40mg I started feeling anxious, irritable and awful in the morning. It took me a while to realize what was going on because until then I was feeling fine for weeks! I thought i was just having some bad days at work and deadline stress got to me.\n\nWhen it dawned on me I dialed back and learned that 30mg was not enough. So I asked my doctor to prescribe some 5mg pills for the morning and that did the trick!\n\nWhenever I took my pill, I started the stopwatch on my phone and whenever I checked in with myself or when a timer went off (using Pomodoro or something), I checked in with myself and compared to the stopwatch and did a quick log in my chat program with my partner like \"3h17m Focus good, somewhat distractable by intrusive thoughts, but better than yesterday #meds\" Using the hashtag to make it searchable.\n\nAfter a couple of days I had some data and I also cross referenced it with release profiles I found online.\n\nI was able to compare my mood, emotional stability and focus to where in the release cycle the meds should be at. It is not exact because everybody has a different metabolism, but it helped me figure out my therapeutic range and also learn when it starts to taper off.\n\nWhen you notice it tapering off, you have to realize that it is a delayed effect to what you see on the graph. So it can be a bit tricky to figure out good timing for the second dose since it also has an on-ramp that overlaps with the first dose's offramp.\n\nIt still took some experimentation, but using this data-based approach made it feel like a project I am in control of, instead of just firing shots in the dark and being frustrated as to why it is not working and feeling at the mercy of this pill.\n\nEventually I landed on 35-30 and the right timings and meals to go along with it. Now when I take my first dose, I set a timer for when it is time for the second one and I just plan my day around that and do micro adjustments even to this day.\n\nAs soon as you have success with a pill, or even if you had success in the past, try to remember when you took it, how your sleep was, what you ate/drank with it, etc, if the sun was shining (for example, coffee is a stimulant and can seriously mess with the effect of the meds).\n\nWhat you eat with you pill, the pH value of it and how much fiber it has etc, also has a big impact on how the meds work.\n\nI also take vitamin D, omega 3, magnesium, zinc and all that good stuff.. basically, make sure you are not mistaking symptoms of some deficiency for the pill not doing, or, making sure you have all your bases covered so the pill can do its thing.\n\nWhen you're sick or in a bad mood or under the weather, I noticed that it either doesn't work or can make it worse. A lower dose on those days seems to help me stabilize my emotions and not make me antsy and irritable.\n\nHope that helps! It can be a lot of work, but if you take it one day at a time and do small adjustments based on what you observe about yourself, you will get there!"

More likely just an awareness of how dreadful my focus was on most things!

    "comment": "Idk if this comment bares resentment toward that ‚Äúera‚Äù but I would like to make the case that pushing pills to ADHD youth is a good thing. \n\n1. A very large proportion of children with adhd who start medication (70-80%) have significant decreases in negative symptoms and have lasting positive outcomes, many even after stopping the medication. On top of that around 9% of children medicated early on are able to attain comparable cognitive performance (in ADHD relevant metrics) to non ADHD adults.\n\n2. Meds are a medical intervention (shocker) and they are often a more accessible alternative to therapy and they can also serve the dual benefit of enlightening the child‚Äôs parents to the fact that ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder and not some nebulous lack of character or a deep personal failing of laziness. That can be transformative in that child‚Äôs life and see them avoid years of trauma or just be able to live in a more supportive environment. An environment with more tools and information at their disposal. \n\nObviously parents can be supportive and children can be well informed without ‚Äúpill pushing‚Äù and the combination of meds and therapy is almost always shown to be more effective and the benefits most long-lasting but meds (especially at an early age) should play a significant role in the individualized medical care of youth, at least until we understand the neural underpinnings of ADHD and related conditions."

About 6 years ago I had one pharmacist tell me my drs were wrong and he didn‚Äôt want to fill a new blood pressure med for me because I am on adderall. I said ‚Äúif you look the same dr gave me both, it‚Äôs ok she knows. Good looking out though!‚Äù Then he was like ‚Äúyeah I don‚Äôt want to fill the adderall for you anymore then.  You can‚Äôt take both they cancel each other out.‚Äù Of course that‚Äôs not true.  What this idiot meant was that adderall might be raising my bp ‚Äî which might be why I needed the bp med.  truth is I was severely depressed and stressed out and my husband moved out. Money was tight to say the least,  I was taking care of my chronically ill sister, I mean life was very hard so to threaten me with not filling my adderall  just made me bawl.  In the Safeway, bawling.  I couldn‚Äôt take it.  I finally got him to give it all to me.  But I am so confused what the f any of what me and my dr decide best for me is any of his business.  If there is going to be a problem interaction that will kill me?  yeah I want a heads up but they should just keep the bs fake doctoring to themselves.  Shut up and fill the scrip!  Please.

It's stupid counterintuitive insurance bullshit where they have established this right where they get to micromanage what your doctor says you need (a small percentage of the time, the insurance company ends up having the better interest of the patient in mind because a doctor may be overprescribing due to financial kickbacks from the pharmaceutical company .. but in general, it's to use any excuse not to cover the cost)  \n\nThe pharmacist/pharmacy has no jurisdiction there... They cannot approve or deny anything ... They are the middle man... \n\nI am guaranteeing you that they incorrectly communicated what is needed, or you misunderstood them, or both...

They then said they‚Äôd consider filling my controlled substance only if I switched ALL medications over to them. I can‚Äôt make this up lol. I was floored.\n\nI immediately called Walgreens Corporate and reported them- I thought it was definitely illegal for them to not fill a prescription I needed (and it made me so mad that they would ‚Äúconsider it‚Äù if I gave them routine business). It felt like someone was dangling my prescription over me while I struggled.  \n\nTurns out, according to Walgreens Corporate, the head pharmacist can absolutely deny filling a prescription if they have their reasoning behind it. I was shocked by this because how can you be a pharmacist and deny someone their medication???\n\nI ended up finding a CVS 50 minutes away that had the prescription I needed and they filled it, no problems or questions asked. I will never set foot in a Walgreens again."

I could see someone like that requiring documentation that there's good reason to being taking that amount (and that late into the day) maybe like a person adhd is severe where they might get into car crashes if unmedicated idk or maybe they have narcolepsy etc etc. But just a typical standard prescription needing documentation seems excessive.

When prescribing medicine or dosage doctor might not know of other medication or supplements you are taking. some combos are extremely likely to kill you , and pharmacists are not just cashiers, they must have degree in pharmacology (in most cases I know of) , and as such they might even know more than doc's about some medication.   \nOh, and  if you are buying retinol without \"pill\" contraception.  \n\nall of these are extremely important cases when pharmacist has to work as \"last safetyguard\" to save your life (not yours per se , but they do save lives.

    "comment": "I have ADHD, I am on a stimulant, AND I work in a pharmacy. It sucks. But they're not doing this to anybody on purpose. It isn't even our fault on this level. A lot of pharmacy techs don't ask before they Tell people if they do or don't have a controlled substance. Which, considering what it is, a lot of pharmacies won't tell someone if they have anything in stock because it makes it easier for them to get robbed. Pharmacy techs aren't supposed to be telling anyone if we have control substances. Some do unfortunately and some don't unfortunately. \n\nThat doesn't change the fact that pharmacies only get a certain amount and if someone else knew coming to that store needs a stimulant they're not going to help that person over a fully established regular patient that might not get their medication. There is a big problem with shortages and back orders of all stimulants, because when people can't get one strength or one brand they try to get another strength or another brand which throws it into continual back order or ordering problems or not being in stock and able to get.\n\nNot saying it's right but there have to be better ways for the DEA to handle this and people really need to understand that it's not the pharmacy's fault. Do people honestly think we just hoard medication that we can't take ourselves because we want to? Oh yeah let me go grab that non-existent stock out of the back room that doesn't exist. Everybody is having an issue And I wish it would get better. Plus can you imagine being a child that can't get their medication? I've had to tell parents we don't have it. I would give up my medication for a child even though the last time I did I almost had my house go up for auction (Non-Payment of house taxes), didn't file my taxes until last week, And almost got fired three times within a month.\n\nEverybody thinks they know what's going on and they think they know who the problem is but really they don't.

Every single red flag had a good explanation, I didn't have to give it but I certainly could have. In my opinion the pharmacist was not doing due diligence, although I'm personally largely against the regulation of medication in general.\n\nIn this case I had recently swapped doctors because mine had moved to another state to retire. I had also swapped from extended release to an equivalent dose of immediate release because of an issue with how I metabolize it. The new doctor sent two prescriptions (refill plus new lower dose) because I changed halfway through the month, the old doctor only had me on the higher dose.

It had taken me weeks to even leave the house for more than a quick trip to the shops because I couldn't stop crying.\n\nShe insisted on asking me to give details of my issues in front of a half full waiting room.

They may prescribe younger kids diagnosed with ADHD Ritalin more, because of the milder stimulant effects, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs FOR children. What an irresponsible thing to say."

I‚Äôm of the opposite opinion meaning children should not be labeled ADD/ADHD until they‚Äôre at the very least puberty stage and just because the drugs are effective doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they‚Äôre necessary. People who don‚Äôt know about these disorders tend to directly relate them with schooling although they directly affect more serious problems than just learning. I‚Äôve been on and off of different medications since I was roughly 11 and having a stable dose of Adderall for the past 8 years has helped me in different situations and I‚Äôm sick of know it alls who think that stimulants only help because they make you hyper when as having ADHD treated with amphetamines does almost the exact opposite and I become much more calm and less mentally distracted. I honestly could care less about people‚Äôs opinions about my treatment and chalk it up to being misinformed of not only ADHD but also how medications work for people who do/don‚Äôt have it.\n\n      My point is that if you feel like you have these disorders talk to real doctors who understand the symptoms and treatments available because these medications should be given with great care and knowledge. Also professionals who know the difference between ADD and ADHD because while similar issues are usually treated with different medications. Pharmacists are not doctors and need to focus on their jobs and leave their personal opinions to themselves where they belong."

For example, I work with 6 pharmacist. 3 are very knowledgeable about ADD meds, mainly because they are either themselves ADD or have kids that are. The other 3 have zero knowledge of them.

The way the contract works is you *must* have a regular carrier assigned to the route your house is on. That person is required to be a full time employee. ‚ÄúPart Time‚Äù as a carrier really refers to the fact you don‚Äôt have your own route, and so are not guaranteed 40 hours a week. The only way your mail would only be getting delivered by part time carriers is of your route is an Auxiliary route (a route that is too small to require 40 hours of service a week, and so has no Regular carrier assigned to it). The postal service‚Äôs current biggest problem is a staffing shortage, so good on your city if their part time carriers are struggling to get hours. That weirdly means the system is working. Most places ‚ÄúPart Time‚Äù actually means 15-32 hours of mandate Overtime."

    "comment": "2 problems with non-ADHDers using stimulants recreationally like this:\n\n1. The whole reason we take them is because we're at a disadvantage. Stimulants bring us closer to the level that non-ADHDers are on, and when they get the added advantage of being on stimulants with a neurotypical brain, the disparity in performance persists. \n2. Similar to what you said: it threatens access to stimulants for those who actually need them. Stimulant addiction is the main thing that people think about when we talk about ADHD and ADHD meds, and that's not to say it isn't an issue that needs to be addressed, but it isn't stressed enough that the main people getting addicted to stimulants are people who DON'T have ADHD. Doctors are now less likely to prescribe stimulants to people who actually have a diagnosis because stimulant abuse is being emphasized so heavily, and it also leads many insurance companies to refuse covering them at all. My prescriptions are $300 per month. It's literally cheaper for me to buy the meds I need off of my friends than to get them through my doctor.\n\nPersonally, **I don't \"blame\" people who aren't diagnosed who used stimulants to do better in school/work.** I blame the culture that's causing increased recreational stimulant use, specifically the growing pressure to do more and do it all perfectly. Humans are not meant to endure the expectations that are now being placed on us (we're expected to be productive all the time, school is getting harder, we're expected to be able to handle growing workloads while still volunteering and doing extracurriculars, employers expect us to revolve our lives around our jobs, etc.). \n\nThe problem is that those who are trying to fight the addiction problem are focusing more on the addiction itself than the cause of it. Stop making people with normal brains feel like they're deficient and they won't turn to drugs that aren't meant for them."

I can come with behaviour problems, like not being able to self-regulate your feelings very well. They tend to be very big. One of the ways TBI patients benefit from treatment with stimulants is that it helps with self-regulation. In a similar way, ADHD meds up my emotional resilience-- and one of the reasons I  had \"treatment resistant depression\" for years was because the underlying cause, ADHD, was not medicated. It wasn't a situation of severe depression at all, it was dealing with a neurological disorder. One of the clues that I got from my boyfriend, to indicate he might be on the ADHD spectrum, is not just his typical ADD behaviours-- it's also how immediately he spirals into guilt or bursts into happiness, and how his emotions almost distract him from what he should be paying attention to (even though he's very bright; his intellect doesn't regulate his bursts of dysregulated emotion).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nADHD is a complex disease and idiots who illegally abuse substances give us bad rep for the work we do."

But despite understanding all that, it's still really hard to hear about people abusing amphetamines because what is a \"helpful little trick to get through finals\" to you is lifesaving for me. I don't really like taking my meds that much, they make me feel inadequate even though I know they're just leveling the playing field and giving me a chance to compete at the same level as neurotypical people. This idea comes from years of being told by teachers (and sometimes my own parents) that I was dumb, lazy, or \"just needed to try harder\", completely missing the fact that I was trying harder than all my peers and still wasn't able to catch up. But that is beside the point I want to make. The fact of the matter is that non-ADHD brains can choose to take amphetamines to boost their performance ([this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28699832) study actually shows there is no increase in performance in non-ADHD brains), but I cannot afford the same luxury.

It really does significantly contribute to the heavy stigma we face, that surfaces in many ways; family misunderstandings, friends seeking drugs, excessive medical & legal hoops, and outright inability to access medications.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, I temper that with reminding myself that many off-prescription (not most, but still a significant %) have undiagnosed ADHD, anxiety, social interaction issues, Asperger's (or otherwise on the spectrum), dyslexia, or other learning disabilities. These under-served people, who also suffer from the overall health & legal system's failures in effectively addressing mental health, are just looking for something that works. Something that can help them act \"normal\", complete school work like someone \"normal\", effectively do their day jobs like a \"normal\" person, or just clear their minds of the various distracting negative thoughts due to their own unique seratonin/dopamine/whatever chemical imbalance. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan't forget these people, lost down the cracks, nor lump them in with recreational users."

The amount of people who abuse Adderall/Ritalin in this way just further enforce this mindset.\n\nIn addition to that I'm also concerned about their health. It's not something that's made for people without ADHD, and taking it for reasons like this puts them at risk for addiction.

It's not just in school where adderall is used by folks who aren't prescribed. It happens all the time in the workplace too. It's not as if these pills aren't easily accessible... The people selling them are usually people with a prescription.\n\nThe real issue here is that in the US we love our drugs. It's big. What makes everything worse is that we have this hustle culture that consumes our daily lives. You start noticing it in highschool, then it's full blown everywhere once you enter the workforce. You have to hustle and keep your nose to the grindstone! Your performance is valued above everything. Why wouldn't you take a pill that will make you more efficient? No one will know the difference, and the only result will be that you perform higher. I feel like we need a value shift."

It also gets me to the classroom door with socks on BOTH feet, my own unborrowed scantron and pencils and the presence of mind to have already muted my cell phone BEFORE it goes off mid-test and gets me kicked out. I'll probably even remember where I parked afterwards too. \n\nThat is what adderall helps me do. All the academic facts I am supposed to remember to pass the test are minor details compared to the many-periled task of getting myself how and where and when I need to be (and in possession of the appropriate pencils/scantron etc) to prove I know those facts. And it helps me navigate the saga of getting myself back to class again and again in between test days. \n\nIt's oh so very helpful, but not the way they'd think lol.\n\nIt bothers me to see other people take them when not needed, but mostly just when I feel worried it might become harder (harsher prescribing laws etc) for me to get my meds. Some people are just better than me at stuff, without ever taking anything. So if a few more join those ranks of people who are way better at stuff than me,  for awhile (while the meds last anyway lol), I feel like it's just kind of how life goes. I do appreciate never having to worry about drug tests for jobs or being found with drugs that aren't mine though. i'd be constantly worried about it were I a NTP with drugs I wasn't prescribed."

Who fucking cares? People use drugs to better themselves and improve their lives, they have for as long as humans have existed, and that's absolutely fine.

Drug criminalisation is purely political and always has been. Controlling medicine has nothing to do with drug abuse and doesn't reduce it, it's only done because it would be hard to push the narrative that drugs are bad when they're being routinely used for good. The hysteria surrounding addiction has been manufactured by decades of propaganda and suppression of genuine information. The compulsion to avoid risk of addiction above all else comes from legislation implemented by politicians for political reasons. The scientific and medical communities have been saying for years that these restrictions don't decrease addiction and instead massively increase drug related harm."

Suspicion and maltreatment from doctors, pharmacists, family members, etc. that we face trying to get our scripts because of how heavily stimulants are stigmatized due to the moral panic over addiction 2. Doctors becoming less likely to provide stimulant scripts for ADHD patients who actually need them and 3. Insurance companies refusing to cover our scripts because of the backlash about feeding the stimulant addiction \"crisis.\"\n\nThe reality that drug laws only serve those in power and merely perpetuate addiction is fucked but it doesn't change the fact that this is the system in place that we have to deal with. I personally think all drugs in their safest forms should be legal, but that's an unattainable fantasy in this country.

    "comment": "I definitely think that it's ok for undiagnosed people (who have ADHD, even if they don't know it) to be taking ADHD meds. That is one aspect of my original post that I wish I had mentioned. The way I see it is sorta close to the idea of self-medicating, but not really because in this particular setting it has a positive effect on the individual. I would a million times over rather have somebody with undiagnosed ADHD take stimulants to help themselves work and function because **they need it** and it really is a life changing drug. I definitely don't encourage or condone any illegal activities, and I'd strongly advise people to find a doctor they trust to help get them a diagnosis and figure out a treatment plan as soon as possible. The only time I would ever get really upset over someone taking unprescribed stimulants is if they purposely did it with the intent to get an unfair advantage over their peers.  From what I've read on this post, 99.99% of undiagnosed ADHD individuals who have taken stimulants illegally don't do it for that reason. They do it because they feel that they can't keep up with their peers or complete \"simple\" tasks that neurotypical people can handle with no problem, and that, in my book, is 100% justified. I was really lucky to be able to start meds in 6th grade, and while it took a couple of years to find the right medication and dosage, I am still *incredibly* lucky to get help at such a young age. So for all you ADHD-brains out there who may be undiagnosed and taking stimulants without a prescription, please, please, PLEASE! try and schedule an appointment with a trusted physician as soon as possible, (most) know what they are doing and want to help you. But more importantly, don't let others get you down and make you feel like a degenerate because you couldn't get the help you needed when you were younger and had to resort to more drastic measures to get help later in life. It's not your fault. You just didn't have access to the resources you needed until many years later, and there should be no shame in that. ADHD has the word \"disorder\" in it for a reason, and all of us on here have felt the struggle first hand. As for people who don't have ADHD and just want our meds so they can get an unfair advantage, fuck you. You don't know the struggle. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL; DR: It's fine if you take unprescribed amphetamines if you have undiagnosed ADHD, just please, please, please try to find a trusted medical professional to help you as soon as you can. Street drugs and self-medicating is not safe.  \n\n\nAs for your own personal struggles, I hope you can get help soon! I know what it's like to be in that terrible place where you need help but can't get it. I also have inattentive-type ADHD and in 7th grade, I was taken off my meds (Adderall) because my doctor thought I maybe didn't need it anymore and my mom was fearful of me becoming addicted because I had to take a somewhat large dose. I went from being on the honor roll (all A's and no more than 2 B's) to nearly failing 7th grade. But that was just in middle school, and I can't imagine how tough it would be to go off my meds again now. I wish you the best of luck and want you to remember that you are not dumb, you are not stupid, and you are not lazy. You are trying your hardest, and the education system (and arguably modern society in general) has failed people like us. I sincerely hope you, and any other undiagnosed people reading this, can receive the help you need soon because you deserve it."

They might benefit from 5-10mg while a hard case of ADD might take a lot more to get their brain to focus. I had a client taking 120mg/day. My ADD is pretty bad, but that much Ritalin would turn me into a woodchuck, gnawing on all the furniture.\n\nThe problem with stigma is that here in the US, mental health problems are frequently handled by the justice system. If you're a drug addict, you go to jail. If you're schizophrenic and having a bad episode, you end up in jail. Our psychiatric health system has major room for improvement. I mean, when you really think about it, if you end up in jail for a good reason, odds are you probably just need psychiatric help, not years sitting in a cage to scare you straight."

I've been asked if I'm sure I need these pills, questioned about why I was drinking a coffee, had my i.d. checked repeatedly in the same transaction, etc, etc, etc. Finally a Walgreens opened in my doctor's building, and he pretty much deals with my doctor's medical partners exclusively. So he doesn't feel the need to question the validity of every prescription, lol."

The cons outweigh the plusses. But, they feel good and they feel hyperfocused, and cognitively they KNOW they took a brain booster-- so there's a lot of placebo effect benefit. The conviction that they're being super-boosted does more than the actual drug. In contrast, an ADHD person might doubt their meds but still would receive performance benefit. I count my pills, and there've been more than a few days where I'm humming along, proud of myself for getting through my to-do list, etc. and all without taking meds that morning. Later I go to get coffee, to keep up the boost with a short-term stimulant because evening's approaching and my thoughts are wandering-- and I look at my pill bottle and realize \"oh shoot, I did take vyvanse\"."

Most neurotypical people see ADHD as a problem with paying attention to schoolwork, etc, and so the treatment for ADHD (stimulants) is looked at as \"this drug makes you pay attention to schoolwork, etc.\" \n\nIt's actually way more complicated than that. ADHD brains are now thought to have quite profound structural differences which include underdevelopment of grey matter in certain areas and dysfunctional dopaminergic pathways. These pathways are what allow you subconsciously to integrate \"I know this is/isn't a good idea,\" with doing/not doing the thing that is a good idea. Giving ADHD brains more dopamine allows some of the dysfunctional signaling to get turned up/down, thus allowing people with ADHD to mimic the behavior of neurotypicals, and part of that is paying attention to the things we're supposed to be paying attention to. \n\nI have no idea what amphetamines feel like to \"normal\" brains, but from what I've seen from ADHD and non ADHD friends, we aren't having the same experience, hahahaha."

I was failing assignments again, and my friendships were falling apart, so I finally decided to pay to get an assessment done.

In Yemen, it‚Äôs incredibly hard to see a therapist because people‚Äîyour own family even‚Äîstart treating you like you‚Äôre losing your mind. I‚Äôve dealt with severe depression and anxiety for over six years. At one point, I couldn‚Äôt sleep for more than 2‚Äì3 hours a night for almost a year. It wrecked my life‚ÄîI lost my job, ruined my relationships, and my ADHD spiraled out of control. That‚Äôs when I realized I‚Äôve had ADHD for 25 years without knowing.\n\nI only found out two years ago, but for a long time, I couldn‚Äôt do anything about it. I was too afraid of what people would say if I went to therapy. Then, after hitting rock bottom like never before, I felt like I was truly losing it. That‚Äôs when I finally built up the courage to see a therapist. But when I told him about my ADHD, he dismissed me completely. He said I was just being soft, that I didn‚Äôt resist enough, and that I was looking for excuses or trying to get easy access to meds. Bro, I felt so defeated, like everything I went through was for nothing. It felt like the end of the road for me.\n\nA year later, I hit another rock bottom. I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore, so I decided to search for a therapist who actually understands ADHD. Can you imagine? There wasn‚Äôt a single one in my entire country. Just when I was about to give up, I found a new therapist about three months ago. She works mostly with kids who have ADHD, but I went to her anyway. It took a lot of effort to convince her that I had ADHD, but after multiple tests, she confirmed it. She also told me that Yemen doesn‚Äôt have access to the best medications for ADHD. She prescribed me a children‚Äôs medication (STRATOMOX) in higher doses as a last resort.\n\nI was desperate, so I started taking it, even though it‚Äôs really expensive. Some weeks, I couldn‚Äôt afford it, so I had to stop. Honestly, I haven‚Äôt seen much improvement yet, but I don‚Äôt know what else to do.\n\nI‚Äôm suffering just like you, and I hope one day we can both find a way out of this. üíî"

I feel like I had to work so much harder than everyone else just to be at the same place.\n\nMy first ADHD doctor used to say that the things you do to help ADHD are like legs of a table, and that medication is only one leg. You might be able to function without the medication if you do enough of the other things - but medication alone won't help you.\n\nEvery small thing you learn to do now will help you later when you can actually have medication.\n\nSome of the things that have actually helped me: \n\nProtein. Especially for breakfast. Try to eat a decent amount of protein in the first hour after you wake up.\n\nExercise. Cardio helps me the most. I started to really see a difference after I was doing an hour a day, several times a week. You don't have to do this all at once, and that might even be counter productive. Try to add in as much walking as you can, all throughout the day. Walking is so helpful, especially outdoors. But whenever possible, you also need to sprint, to make yourself breathe hard for a time.\n\nExercise part 2: walk while you study. When I took my notes, I actually wrote them as questions to ask myself. Then as I walked, I would read and answer my questions. This is how I studied, and for me it worked.\n\nAvoid additives. Things like preservatives and dyes in your food and drinks. These are known to be bad for ADHD.\n\nFish. I think the research on this is not complete but all my doctors have recommended eating fish. This also helps with getting more protein.\n\nCaffeine. I can't have it now with medication, but caffeine was a very big help to me before I was diagnosed. Just be careful not to overdo it. It's helpful while you have to be still and concentrate.\n\nSugar. It isn't sugar itself, but more about stabilizing blood sugar. I noticed my ADHD symptoms improved as I was working to stabilize my blood sugar for other reasons. To do this, I am careful to limit refined sugar and simple carbohydrates like white bread and white potatoes. When I have something like this, I eat a small amount and pair it with protein and healthy fats.\n\nFind a calendar/reminder system that works for you and stick with it. Whatever this is. Every single thing has to go into this. I set calendar alarms on my phone for everything I need to remember to do, but my life is more simple now. At one point I used a bullet journal when I had a lot to remember and that worked quite well. For this to work, I had to get one that I could carry everywhere, all the time. Writing with pen and paper has always been effective for me.\n\nTweak everything. You have a unique and creative brain. Let it run wild. Find new solutions. Try many things. You are a scientist working to understand yourself. If you fail at something, then you have learned that part of your system failed. Don't worry about following any system except what works for YOU."

I worked with my own adhd, my children's adhd as well as worked in a school with students with adhd. There is a ton of information on youtube and reddit. But looking at adhd from a teacher standpoint one of my favorite YouTube people is Seth Perler. He works with students and teachers and uses a lot of things my school used. I really like his basic hands on and experienced approach. The second recommendation is movement breaks. We'd have kids squirming all over the place in class. We'd take a break, they'd run around, come back and can concentrate better. Run around the outside of the building, put in some gym time etc. Overall having a steady workout routine is good, actually have a daily routine/schedule to help your body, balanced eating is good, all the healthy stuff."

You need to address specifically which ADHD symptoms impact your life and to what severity. As someone who went to college unmedicated and untreated, it is absolutely possible. You would just have to be more disciplined and more aware of meeting your daily needs before you can perform in school. College will require you to manage your health as well as your grades, but being prepared is the key. You should take this time to learn good coping skills to help you regulate your emotions. Take the time to learn how to take notes and keep yourself organized during class and after class. Also, if you have good friends and family, find a good support system so when you can call when you feel down on yourself. Always always always make time to eat sleep and do something fun for yourself, we are not motivated by normal achievements. We are not programmed to be good at forming habits so give yourself grace and extra time to do nothing if you wish. Skip a day if you must, but go tomorrow. \nYou are an adult now, but that‚Äôs the best part!It‚Äôs entirely on you to manage it however you see fit. You got this!"

Now I'm a medical doctor in the US.\n\nI would suggest dealing with comorbid mental health difficulties(Depression, Anxiety..) , which are extremely common in ADHD. It does not have to be devere to become problematic. I never thought counseling would benefit me until I started it for adhd and dealt with other dormant problems too. It's very hard to focus when you have emotionally more important worries. It will make managing ADHD much easier. From my personal experience and lots of research managing ADHD is basically building an effective routine or eliminating the need for decision-making.\n\nHow I became efficient: My study period was tied to a family member's working hours. I had to leave and come back at a certain time with her and went to the library or coffee shops(which only were associated with studying).  I put a lot of effort into planning the whole week/month (depending on situation). I planned every hour for different subjects) study resources. every other hour was free, meaning I could do whatever I wanted, study, eat or play clahs royale. You should give you ADHD some time to express itself too ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|hug). If I could not study enough in dedicated time, even in periods of important exams. Its equally important to dedicate time to having fun. Basically control your time and avoid the greatest threat - procrastination.\n\nA week before I started this routine, I could not imagine myself being so efficient and doing that. It may sound hard, but as long as you eliminate the need of frequent decision-making, its gonna go smoothly.\n\nLast thing. Nicotine and caffeine are stimulants. Don't start smoking, that's gonna make your condition and health even worse, but using nicotine patches or gums  while studying can improve your focus. Simple advice but don't drink coffee after noon(at least routinely).\n\nThere most probably will be  some non-stimulant medications available and they are proven to be effective. Try to find a good mental health professional, don't delay it for years like I did. good luck!"

Divide a cup of coffee into four shots that you take each hour instead of just drinking it in the first hour. This method has been tested on general population and shows that people stay more alert through a morning. Test yourself and adjust amounts to see if you get a benefit.\n\nOther DIY option some use is nicotine in the form of lozenges or patches. Have to be careful with this one as nicotine becomes addictive when you exceed 6mg per day roughly. So, you could use up to three 2mg nicotine lozenges each day as a form of stimulant to see how they work for you. Without the negative compounds found in tobacco, nicotine itself is a lot like caffeine, but can work better for some people. Just stay very low on doses. I‚Äôve done this and found it helped some when I was already engaged in the work I wanted to do.\n\nWhatever you try, just be measured and lean on the side of not risking your health."

I'm not saying don't get medicated, you make your choices, but know that you can do without it. ADHD isn't only weaknesses, it gives you superpowers if you can channel them. I'm not the only one here who did it. What you absolutely need is : a system.\n\nYour productivity system must be tailored to your needs and what makes you special. My system is simply morning and evening habits, and using apps to store and track all my tasks, projects and notes.\n\nIdentify your problem, try solutions, keep what works and reject what doesn't. Assemble what suits you into a system : build habits (Atomic Habits by James Clear was a life changer), have timers and alarms on your phone, take written notes, have flashcards for your studies, review them every day. If you're taking the bus, read your flashcards. Taking a dump? Read your flashcards. Doing the laundry or washing the dishes? Buy airpods and listen to a podcast. Memory is a muscle, so is discipline. Do less: work smarter, not harder, optimize what you're spending time on.\n\nThe best tools are: a calendar, a notebook, and friends that support you. Build discipline like it's a muscle and build your personal productivity system like it's a master work of art.\n\nYou're not a failure, you're very young and you're in your formative years.

When 30 min-1hr is very helpful. Eating a good diet, high protein is supposed to help as well. Prepping foods beforehand or food you can just pick up and eat on whim with no prep will help you be consistent. \n\nSleep, super important. The more you run on fumes, the harder it is to make yourself do what you need. \n\nFinally, some caffeine is one of the oldest ways to self medicate. Just try not to fuck up your sleep with it. \n\nIf you have to pick one of these, I'd highly suggest the intense exercise. It'll help you regulate everything else"

I'm 28y old (finished my first degree in college without knowing anything about having the disorder), just recently I got my diagnosis and started the treatment.   \nMany of us, for years self medicated (may it be ilegal drugs), like drinking a lot of coffee or tea. You can try doing exercises, specific diet, supplementation, etc.   \nTry reading books about ADHD that brings a different approach/ non pharmaceutical. Hope you do well!"

In Yemen, it‚Äôs incredibly hard to see a therapist because people‚Äîyour own family even‚Äîstart treating you like you‚Äôre losing your mind. I‚Äôve dealt with severe depression and anxiety for over six years. At one point, I couldn‚Äôt sleep for more than 2‚Äì3 hours a night for almost a year. It wrecked my life‚ÄîI lost my job, ruined my relationships, and my ADHD spiraled out of control. That‚Äôs when I realized I‚Äôve had ADHD for 25 years without knowing.\n\nI only found out two years ago, but for a long time, I couldn‚Äôt do anything about it. I was too afraid of what people would say if I went to therapy. Then, after hitting rock bottom like never before, I felt like I was truly losing it. That‚Äôs when I finally built up the courage to see a therapist. But when I told him about my ADHD, he dismissed me completely. He said I was just being soft, that I didn‚Äôt resist enough, and that I was looking for excuses or trying to get easy access to meds. Bro, I felt so defeated, like everything I went through was for nothing. It felt like the end of the road for me.\n\nA year later, I hit another rock bottom. I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore, so I decided to search for a therapist who actually understands ADHD. Can you imagine? There wasn‚Äôt a single one in my entire country. Just when I was about to give up, I found a new therapist about three months ago. She works mostly with kids who have ADHD, but I went to her anyway. It took a lot of effort to convince her that I had ADHD, but after multiple tests, she confirmed it. She also told me that Yemen doesn‚Äôt have access to the best medications for ADHD. She prescribed me a children‚Äôs medication (STRATOMOX) in higher doses as a last resort.\n\nI was desperate, so I started taking it, even though it‚Äôs really expensive. Some weeks, I couldn‚Äôt afford it, so I had to stop. Honestly, I haven‚Äôt seen much improvement yet, but I don‚Äôt know what else to do.\n\nI‚Äôm suffering just like you, and I hope one day we can both find a way out of this. üíî\n\nSorry for yapping too ü§£"

My father was extremely strict with me, and while his methods‚Äîlike threateningü•äü•≤ me about bad grades or making poor decisions‚Äîmight not have been great for my childhood experience, they did push me to succeed despite my ADHD. As a kid with ADHD, I struggled a lot: procrastinating, making mistakes, and delaying everything until the last minute. But thanks to the fear-driven motivation and adrenaline rush, I managed to get things done in record time.\n\nI wasn‚Äôt perfect, but I did pretty well for someone with ADHD in school and life. However, things changed once I went to college and started earning my own money. Being far away from my father, I slowly lost control of myself. Without that external pressure, I didn‚Äôt realize how much I relied on fear and panic as motivators. Two years later, I hit rock bottom and couldn‚Äôt pull myself out, no matter how hard I tried.\n\nWhy? Because throughout my childhood, I never developed self-discipline. Instead, I depended on fear triggers that I couldn‚Äôt replicate or control. The irony is, I‚Äôm still grateful to my father. Without his strictness, I might‚Äôve turned out worse. No hard feelings there.\n\nNow that I understand my ADHD better, I‚Äôm working on finding solutions.

Like you said, the adrenaline, being in constant fight or flight mode, does wonders for battling ADHD üòÖ I wasn‚Äôt aware of my ADHD until after college, when I finally started counseling and got on medication for my anxiety. I suddenly was a lot worse at being productive and doing things on time, and I realized later it was because I no longer had that anxiety pushing me through it. Now I‚Äôm diagnosed and on medication for my ADHD, and it‚Äôs been life changing. I‚Äôm so much happier without the negative reinforcement being the main driver in my life. Good luck on your journey, I hope you can find what works best for being the best you. üôÇ"

My question was similar - when I stay up really late at night studying, when my meds wear off, all of the sudden my peripherals start opening up. I get spooked by items moving in them. He said that it‚Äôs because of the adhd. My brain has taught itself to filter peripherals out but when I am that exhausted, it can no longer do that. So when you are on your ritalin your brain is noticing something that it usually doesn‚Äôt notice. Fascinating stuff. I suggest you tilt your head a little until the effect wears down and try not to focus on it."

Might need a different, non-stim med, or to medicate anxiety also.  I worked in mental health for many years, always talk to your doctor about weird side effects.  There are other options and it‚Äôs easy to just stick with the first thing you‚Äôre prescribed, but it can take tries w other meds before you get one that hits your specific spots."

Very much a type A person with no patience for pseudo science. But as I've become more open to different types lines of evidence I've realized there is a lot western culture has completely written off without giving it a chance. Mediation and mindfulness are thousands of years old and science is just now realizing they might be good for you. I bring this up because your symptoms very much align with the description for a blocked throat chakra. Very much what I have been feeling for a while and just recently realized\n\nThe supposed cause for this is not probably expressing emotions, which is common in ADHD. Random tip, shame is very potent in suppressing emotions you don't want to feel. Anyway, me trying to align this with peer-reviewed knowledge.. I think when the Ego tries to supress emotion, it's still there. It's subconscious. So the subconscious is like priming all the muscles involved in talking, but nothing happens and it just builds up a lot of tension. I'll probably get a lot of hate for pseudoscience, but you learn how to assess evidence well during a PhD and I know what I know and realize some people can be convinced of a lot of stuff. Anyways, I hope that gets better for you"

I can force myself to eat while I‚Äôm medicated, but I don‚Äôt have that pleasure response you‚Äôre supposed to get from eating something tasty. Like, logically I know it‚Äôs my favorite food and I like how it tastes, but my brain doesn‚Äôt light up the way it‚Äôs supposed to, and hunger signals are suppressed so eating involves willpower. Watching food porn (cooking shows lol) sometimes helps me get in the mood.\n\nI often cook meals that taste great reheated to get around this, so that I can eat as soon as my appetite returns. Japanese mixed rice dishes or fried rice are my favorite go-tos, and curries and casseroles can reheat well too. If I don‚Äôt have anything made in advance, keeping a stock of fresh pasta (cooks in a couple minutes instead of 10) is handy, while it cooks I quickly can heat up some sauce, or just add butter and parmesan cheese. Also frozen meals are often really simple to prep if they don‚Äôt need defrosting, and some of them are really good (Trader Joes is the best for this). And yes instant noodles can hit the spot too. My favorite is salt-flavored ramen with butter added to it, or shin ramen when I can‚Äôt find the imported flavors. Crack an egg in it to make it more nutritious."

Thus, once ritalin unlocked my capacity to work effectively and along with the amazing advices on this group - i started creating individual coping mechanisms, one of which was diet management. I usually have the habit of using cooking as a destresser and place where I let myself loose & my adhd mind go into this weird flow state of improvising and cooking something unique everytime. Initially, it was really fun but grew taxing thus i started to plan ahead and do meal preps of short extents. It's really a great way to manage time and be ready, knowing that you have backup prep work that quickly can be turned into any nutritional dishes. Hope, this helps üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

I would recommend in that case having your doctor and teacher/counsellor come up with a plan for the second dose at school with a snack.. you could make some secret healthy treats, (avocado) brownies, (chia seed )puddings, chocolate (avocado) pudding. my mom used to make me the most fun lunches. we're talking a hot dog in a thermos with a little bun and a packet of ketchup and mustard. -> this was the 90s lol.\nstill.. better than an empty stomach.\n\nthe more you can include him in on, to help him feel like it's his idea the better. it may be a great bonding experience too. \n\nplease feel free to DM me if you ever need any other help or have any questions."

I have tried to, like to be polite at a cookout (for instance), and started chewing, and then immediatly spit the food out, gagging.  After that I can't eat for hours.   Alternatively, I can eat COLD lunch meat, as long as it is sliced thin.  Or warm Mac and cheese.  Or warm bacon.  Both the temp and the texture play a major role here.  \n\nCrackers or bread take the edge off the dizzys that hit when you suddenly realize how hungry you are, so that you aren't feeling too awful to eat when a meal if finally put in front of you.  \n\nIf I eat a little something in the morning when talking my meds I find that they still work fine, but have less of an affect on my appetite.  If I take it on an empty stomach I find that 6 to 8 bites of food is all I can stomach at one time.\n\nI hope this helps!"

Convenience also ends up leading to desiring unhealthy foods, and over eating. remember ADHD has to do with dopamine. We are impulsive and easily addicted to things. especially bad fats, carbs and sugars, among other things obviously that your child being young won't have to worry about until they are older.\n\nWe are sensitive and picky, especially as children and that if enabled can cause problem areas for the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"This disorder is defined by a combination of symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. Diagnosis is based on impairment in these two domains determining several problems in personal and academic life. Although it is known that genetic and environmental factors are important in ADHD etiology, how these factors influence the brain and consequently behavior is still under debate\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*environmental factors, including nutrition and household functioning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese are also very bad for your childs microbiome- where you need to have a certain amount of good bacteria.\n\nThere has been a lot fo research about this lately and it has a large impact on things like ADHD.\n\nAn unhealthy microbiome is linked obviously to IBS and other gastrointestinal issues.\n\nThis is where things like probiotics and probiotic rich foods are very important; yogurts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou don't want your child growing up wanting only processed foods, carbs and cheesy foods.\n\nI'm not a pseudo science person, I'm not a vegan or anything like that. I rely heavily on science to form my opinions and understandings and I also have a lot of experience with all these issues and growing up with ADHD without proper nutrition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think the best thing for you to do is to involve your kid in cooking and meals and make it fun and educational for him, while not being a boring drag.\n\nI have a lot of friends with children and they secretly put things like spinach and avocado etc in the foods and the kids are oblivious to it but get nutrition without being scared of green things, which is obviously typical for many children regardless of ADHD."

Incorporating peanut butter is an easy way to add a lot of calories and fats. Convenience is key as you mentioned.\n\nIf your son is ever going through a particularly hard time then there are drinkable meals like Soylent which are good to keep around as a fallback option. These tend to contain around 350-500 calories depending on what brand you buy and are much healthier than not eating at all.\n\nThere's all kinds of easy meal prep out there too. A breadmaker and mixer are so great for making fresh bread and work well with the ADHD flow. Cooking some sort of soup and freezing it in individual portions is also way healthier than canned soups."

What changes emotionally and psychologically have you noticed now off of Concerta?\n\n\nI tried my hand at practically everything as a child and didn't really want to do any of it. after time it grew into a passion, i was a bit resentful for my mom making me dance, she apologized later and said perhaps she was living vicariously through me.\n\nI spent 15 years of my life in an intensive dance program and began loving it. The structure and routine of doing ballet (found in many other hobbies/activities) became detrimental to my well being as a somewhat functional person with ADHD. however none of this really came to light until I was in my late 20's. I am forever grateful for the things my parents made me pursue. I know it's hard. How do you force your child to like/do something, even harder if it's a child with ADHD because we have a hard time focusing, it's frustrating for everyone involved.\n\nIf you have the resources to keep trying different things I definitely recommend that.\nThe team/group activities I participated in were a win/lose situation for me. I had a hard time listening/focusing and fitting in but without those I'm not sure I would have great social skills, which I still have to work at.\nIf it had been up to me at the time I probably wouldn't have agreed or desired to do much if any of it. I acted out, at times my parents were embarrassed.\n\nMy parents ended up finding a real passion for me which was ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING to do with animals. which also taught me some sense of responsibility and it was therapeutic for me to be able to nuture creatures and find my tribe with them.\nI loved horse back riding.\n I ended up being one of the youngest people to volunteer with the SPCA. I loved it!\n I ended up being a little activist. I would sell pens and raise money for them and go to walks for causes. \nIf you can find something like that, which also requires no financial commitment that might be a great idea.\n\nIf you're not looking for ideas or suggestions I apologize. I just have so much love in my heart for children and families dealing with ADHD and want to help as many as I can."

My wife is that way.\n\nWhereas I'm an insomniac. Sleeping medication usually doesn't work for me, even when combined with other depressants. Stimulants can help me stay awake and alert, but don't typically hurt my ability to fall asleep. That drive to stay awake is a force of its own."

Let your body adjust and it will pass. \n\nI think for me it was the cross over point between self medication with caffeine, nicotine and sugar to prescribed medicine where the adaptations I had developed to survive were no longer needed.

What if your body doesn't eliminate it in the same way as expected, like you metabolize it so quickly that it's not going to show up in your urine when you're tested. There's so many variables here and so much so wrong with this punitive and restrictive way of treating you.\n\nYou must be in your late teens or twenties.

    "comment": "Caution: long comment. I hope the bot doesn't bump this comment. \n\n I know many people whose doctors make them drug test and will not prescribe if the medication is not detected in a urine test.  Doctors are extremely cautious here, especially if they practice in a state like New York where paper scripts are illegal and they are not allowed to send controlled or scheduled drugs (narcotics and stimulants) with refills.  \n\nAll scripts are processed electronically, and the scheduled or controlled drug prescriptions get sent through a big brother type of interface before they get to the pharmacy.  \n\nThat interface sends their DEA number along with the patient's prescription and dosing information to the DEA, and it gets dumped into a database that tracks our med usage. They WILL stomp on any doctor they believe is abusing the \"privilege\" of writing prescriptions for scheduled or controlled drugs. \n\nI think there are a lot of states that are similar, and this is why doctors don't hesitate to yank a patient off their meds if that med isn't found in a urine or blood test. \n\nTHE INFORMATION BELOW IS FROM MY NEUROPSYCHIATRIST. I AM NOT A DOCTOR AND DON'T PLAY ONE ON REDDIT. THESE ARE SCENARIOS AND NOT TO BE SEEN AS UNREFUTABLE. \n\nAs far as ritalin and urine tests go, each patient's elimination time will be different. If you have a large body mass, it can be eliminated in under 24 hours.\n\n It's the same if you drink a ton of water. Ritalin is water soluble, so a lot of exercise and a lot of hydration may cause it to leave your body quickly through sweat and urine. \n\nIf you have a high metabolism, ritalin can be excreted from your body in less than a day.  The same goes for hypothyroidism. \n\nThat means it may or may not show up on a urine test depending on your appointment time and when you last took your meds. \n\nTaking 1000 mg or more  of vitamin C daily can also speed up the excretion of Ritalin. \n\nThe converse is true if you don't hydrate well,  have a low body mass, or have a sluggish metabolism.  It will also leave your body more slowly if you eat a high fat diet. \n\nRitalin is rarely detectable in a blood test, which is why blood tests are rarely used. \n\nI don't understand why doctors rely on the unreliability of urine tests for Ritalin.  A hair test is extremely reliable.  Ritalin stays in the hair for around 30 days. Ask your doctor why they aren't testing that way. \n\nMy doctor told me that he only used hair testing if he felt a need to drug test for someone who might be abusing their medication."

Some people have reported that they've come up negative for stimulants in drug tests and are suspecting that there's a lower ammount of active ingredient."

The test results come back negative for my Ativan and Adderall, but positive for rule 4, which I have a medical card for (still doesn't protect me in PA though, which I knew beforehand). I was taken back to the work site and sent home for the day by being escorted to my vehicle and made to drive home. I started work at 5:30 so my wife had no idea what was going on until I luckily made it home and she immediately noticed I wasn't right. I ended up contacting my GP asking what would cause my prescriptions not to show up, at least for my own peace of mind, and after an in person visit he assured me he would look into it. Instead I find out when trying to refill my prescription that there was none, and when contacting the GP's office I was informed he was no longer able to refill or prescribe any controlled substance for me.

But to respond to your comment about ‚Äúyou should not need them at rehab‚Äù; that‚Äôs false. Being in a Residential facility means that you‚Äôre engaging in group sessions, as well as doing ‚Äúhomework‚Äù, which can be working off workbooks, doing essay-like assignments, and doing deep reflections. Not only that, you have to engage in chores, and other duties around the facility.  It‚Äôs like being at school 24/7.  Many people with ADHD are at a higher risk of substance use due to neuro chemical deficiencies, so many red facilities WILL allow medications such as Ritalin or other stimulants, it just takes more attention and risk management on the facility‚Äôs part. \n\nSource: work in substance use field"

A great example is when I‚Äôm cooking. I have almost started fires cooking while unmedicated because I will forget to turn the burner or the oven off.\n\nTo think about it from a rehab perspective, if there were specific tasks to complete like paperwork or chores then there is a 100% chance of unmedicated me not doing those tasks. Group therapy? I‚Äôd be too busy daydreaming. \n\nAll that said, I‚Äôm now surprised to learn that there are rehab places that do not allow their patients to follow their maintenance medication therapy."

    "comment": "Surprisingly, it's not just the liver, but the gastrointestinal tract as well. Only learnt this fact a few months back during the clinical pharmacology course i took, but the intestines express some of the same cytochrome enzymes as the liver, and in some people, the activity is so high, that they metabolise a big portion of the drug before it's even absorbed into the bloodstream. This is something that docs do take into account (or, well, they should). With some drugs, the range of how it's absorbed in different people is insane - i forget which drug group this was, but for some the bioavailability can differ from like 30 to 80% among separate people. In cases where the drug has a narrow therapeutic window sometimes pharmacogenetic testing is done to determine the safest and most effective doses for the patient.\n\nWhen you add hepatic metabolism on top of the intestinal metabolism, which also varies a lot, one person can destroy the drug to almost nothing within first pass metabolism, while a different person might get significant dose dependent side effects from the same dose"

For one, they are SUPER 12-step focused (I'm talking 6-7 meetings a day), and 12-step programs can be very religious and lean into the \"addiction doesn't need medical treatment it needs GOD.\" mentality.* \n\n*So, maybe these facilities also don't think addiction is a real disease either.

I wouldnt remember more than 3 or 4√ó max, over a Whole day, much less just a work shift, regardless of how long it was.\n\nWhat a pain.\nThank goodness you switched.\n\n\nThere was one month this spring where I Never even got my main dose, the extended release capsule I take in the a.m., bc none of the handful of pharmacies in my rural area got any in for close to 2 months...\n\nI was only able to fill the much smaller dose of instant release, so rather than using it as usual- only as needed for as a p.m. boost-  instead that entire, very difficilt month I had to rely on that tiny amount to start my day, and it only lasted 3-4 hrs total . Ug.üôÑ\n\n (such a tiny, \"booster\" dose of IR is only effective relief for me when used in conjunction with my a.m. extended release, bc the initial dose starts to achieve a lesser degree of relief about 4- 6 hrs in, depending on factors like my activity level & meals. When I dont take the booster dose, my ER dose wears off completely within 8-9 hrs... it's so gradual, that I can only tell by my ability to focus growing more and more difficult, whereas the symptons just from a tiny IR dose wearing off are impossible to ignore and really pretty shitty, even if the period of time is short)."

ADHD is unfortunately a condition where even many professionals still believe bullshit lies or aren't aware of the official guidelines and best practices. If you have confirmed, diagnosed ADHD, first-line treatment is stimulants unless something *specifically* makes that impractical for you. The WHO, the World Psychiatric Association and all the other official voices in the field have one overwhelmingly clear recommendation, and that is that ADHD is first and foremost treated with stimulants.  \nThey reduce comorbidities, improve quality of life, increase life expectancy demonstrably, and so on.\n\nChange doctors.

Quality of life is important, but it‚Äôs easy for a clinician to dismiss, when they‚Äôre this focused on their own biases about care.\n\nThis guy needs you to show clear, functional impairment‚Äîcan‚Äôt finish school and work assignments? Declining grades or work reviews (even informal)? Losing important things like your wallet? Forgetting (stove, front door lock) or failing to notice (pedestrians) things that could endanger yourself or someone else? Missing meals, having difficulty with bodily care or household management, having problems with a regular sleep schedule? Write it down, so you‚Äôve got all of it listed, and bring it to your next appointment.\n\nI second the recommendation to seek a different prescriber‚Äîin a pinch, especially when you‚Äôve been on it in the past, your primary care doctor might be willing to prescribe it for you. You can fight with this guy, for now, if you have to, but he‚Äôs probably always going to be a pain in your ass about it. \n\nIf insurance coverage for someone else is a problem, this is another use-case for your list, Call the insurance company; explain that the only provider they cover has taken you off an established medication; that you have experienced serious functional impairments ever since‚Äîuse that phrase‚Äîand that it is important for your wellbeing and basic functioning to see someone who is willing to practice at the standard of care for ADHD.

As a fellow therapist it would be an ethical violation and most like a licensing board compliant for me to push my own beliefs and biases onto a client and even worse if it negatively impacted the clients functioning. The whole point is to do no harm, which could be argued in the case is what the provider did. If this psychiatrist was never going to prescribe a specific medication that it was inappropriate for them to see this client who was already prescribed a stimulant. I‚Äôve experienced this same thing myself and it is infuriating."

She asked me why I went to another provider on my own before talking with her about it.  Not to shame me, but to say, \"Hey.  It's always worth a conversation here and if I *can* support you somehow, I will.  Might be referrals.  Might be offering some medical insight.  Might be labs.  Might be meds.\"\n\nAnd... since I felt bad getting the Rx from her, after accepting it, I still made a formal Psych appointment with another prescriber (I had excellent MH coverage, 0 copay at the time) who actually found my Rx at the time to be insufficient.  She gladly forwarded to my primary.\"\n\nBut yeah.  doctor shopping for meds is a problem - it's hard enough to make sure that the meds are at the pharmacy and not on back order (because of the blasted DEA limiting production) - when it comes to street sales and diversion of stimulant medication.  But the DEA makes it more difficult for legitimate patients."

Also, given the nature of the drug, if you do lose it for good, it provides a safety net from my life falling apart for 3O days or until I can legally fill my script again. Ive learned so many hard lessons with this over the decade. Also, a prescriber went nuts recently due to a family event and I was left without a prescriber while trying to get in with another one and no refills. It kept me alive and sane.

The key is to have a specific spot for your medication and never EVER move it so you always know where it is. It's a piece of consistency that the chaotic ADHD mind can hold onto. It's also a good strategy to make sure you don't lose anything else especially since you live alone so you don't have to worry about anyone moving your shit while cleaning up (my mom does that all the time and I hate it because if I don't specifically warn her not to move something important I can't keep track of any of my belongings)."

It's intended to make treating you more efficient because your medical history can be shared between doctors or hospitals. It's especially helpful in an emergency where you're unconscious, and relatives aren't reliable. It's an obvious and useful addition to the medical toolbox, but if you have any sense of history, you'd naturally opt-out, because you know that things can change very quickly under the right political circumstances.

But then I can't eat. I've tried multiple non-stimulants and they don't work for me or cause bad side effects."

    "comment": "To everyone pointing out that my condition seems like more than ADHD, you're right. However, your conclusion that it's \"just depression\" is incorrect. My primary challenges include ADHD alongside OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder), OCPD (Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder), SCT (Sluggish Cognitive Tempo), Executive Function Disorder, and Maladaptive Daydreaming Disorder. These are the core issues I deal with consistently. Depression and anxiety, on the other hand, are transient occurrences for me. My disability is persistent and remains even when I'm not depressed or anxious.\n\n\nAfter thoroughly analyzing my mental health profile and the patterns in these comorbidities, I‚Äôve reached an important conclusion: what psychiatrists often label as \"severe ADHD\" is actually ADHD intertwined with manifestations of anxiety disorders. The symptoms of ADHD and anxiety overlap so significantly that for many years, they were frequently misdiagnosed as one another. For a long time, psychiatrists also believed that these two conditions couldn‚Äôt coexist.\n\n\nHowever, advancements in research have proven this belief incorrect. It's now understood that impairments in both the serotonergic (serotonin-related) and dopaminergic (dopamine-related) systems can coexist in the brain, resulting in much greater functional impairment. Treating these overlapping conditions is particularly challenging‚Äîa true \"double jeopardy\" situation.\n\n\nWhen I think about ADHD, I visualize it as a tree. Some trees grow only to a certain height and have limited branches. Others grow much taller and wider, developing numerous branches, each bearing its own unique challenges‚Äîlike nests that represent different comorbidities."

But what stimulant medications have you tried, I think you need to go through the gauntlet of drugs to experiment and get yourself out of your rut. Thankful in my situation where I have a lot of difficulties with executive function and Adderall has literally changed my life when I take it. But at the same time, from the short time I've been on it (just a few months), its very exhausting the day after because of, ironically, being very productive lol and the next day I wanna just chill which is stupid but need to get better at (taking my medication daily without fail). Slowly been doing well, you just need to create a routine and once you get into a groove hopefully everything just clicks. Or in your case, it could be that maybe a certain medication isn't the optimal one for you, maybe its Adderall IR/XR, maybe its Vyvanse, maybe its Vyvanse with a boost dose in the afternoon, I would have an indepth conversation with your psychiatrist with exactly what you said just now and see their thoughts on everything, on how you forget to take your Ritalin and maybe there could be a solution in the cards for ya. Or it could be just simply having an alarm at a specific time everyday to take your Ritalin, gets the ball rolling and after a full week you analyze the results and then in addition of what you spelled out, share that as well with your psychiatrist.

I once heard that you brush your teeth at night for your health, and in the AM for the people around you, so if you can even just do it at night, it makes a huge difference for your health. \n\nI know it can be hard, though, especially with object permanency/sensory issues. I think anchoring it to something you HAVE to do or enjoy doing can help. My nighttime routine is the one routine I'm so religious about it's basically obsessive. The trigger is taking care of my cats, which is non-negotiable. It also puts me on the physical path to the next steps: Cleaning the box and feeding the cats puts me in the kitchen where I remember to drink water and take supplements, then I move to the bathroom to shower, and brush teeth *while showering*. For some reason, this feels like saving a step even if it's not. I know some people don't like showers for sensory reasons but, otherwise, this could be a hack!\n\n*Edited: holy typos, Batman"

It‚Äôs wildly common, particularly for women but it also happens in men, for ADHD to be misdiagnosed as depression, because the symptoms of ADHD can look like depression, even though the root cause is totally different. I‚Äôve absolutely struggled with the things OP described here, and it wasn‚Äôt because I was depressed. It was because, for example, when the pandemic first hit and everyone at my job was working from home, my routines (to the extent I had them) completely fell apart. I learned that I really strongly relied upon that outside structure and expectation in order to remember and accomplish basic things. So when I stopped having to get ready for work in the morning, yeah I absolutely had embarrassing stretches where I‚Äôd completely forget about showering, brushing my teeth, etc. And I wasn‚Äôt depressed at all, it was literally just my ADHD/poor executive functioning and working memory that made those things hard to do. It got much better when we started going back to the office a few days a week, and even further improved when my BF at the time started staying over regularly, because literally just being around other people was the reminder/structure I needed to just do those basic tasks."

Wellbutrin doesn‚Äôt address all my ADHD symptoms, but because it manages my depression so well, it gives me the mental bandwidth to focus on managing my ADHD intentionally.  \n\nI found it mostly gave emotional stability, intrinsic motivation, and the ability to shut down negative thought spirals too.

But due to the 10k plus dollars I've had to spend on fixing my teeth over the years due to not brushing them bc of ADHD or depression, and also the massive amounts of tooth pain that came with it, I did successfully start to brush my teeth twice a day, but I could never get myself to floss. Until recently I bought the electric toothbrush/water flosser combo from waterpik. It was expensive, but I now use it to floss twice a day, every time I brush my teeth, because of how satisfying it is and how clean it gets my teeth. 10/10 would reccomend if you can't find the executive function necessary to floss your teeth."

I went back on stimulants of course, as they are the only thing that helps me, I am taking Concerta 2x a day. \n\nI entered into a depression a couple of years ago, largely brought on by business stress and marital stress. I started taking Buproprion again with my Concerta and it is great. I am still fairly miserable (with reason) but at least now I don't cry in my car every day. My moods are evener and I have more patience.   \n  \nI hope this is helpful info fo you."

If this is something you‚Äôd like to do, express to your girlfriend that this is something that could really help you and she can help you over the hurdles.

    "comment": "I come from one of the most backward states in a developing country. Just ten years ago, there was only one psychiatrist in the entire state. While the situation has slightly improved since then, critical resources like counseling and therapy remain unavailable‚Äînot just in my state but even in the neighboring ones. The state of psychiatric care here is abysmal. It is plagued by incorrect and hasty diagnoses, a tendency to overprescribe medications as a \"quick fix\" for mental illnesses that require therapies like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and a shortage of qualified professionals. Neuropsychiatrists are often untrained or underqualified, doctors are overburdened, and the system is riddled with inefficiencies.\n\nSeven years ago, stimulant medications were nearly impossible to find. Drugs like amphetamines, Concerta, duloxetine, and desvenlafaxine are still unavailable in the country. The only stimulant available is a generic version of Ritalin, which is not only highly regulated but also extremely hard to procure. Back then, there was only one pharmacy in the entire state where methylphenidate was stocked.\n\nMental health stigma only made things worse. Visiting a psychiatrist is seen as something only \"mad\" or \"insane\" people would do. Even today, my father refuses to believe that I have crippling neurological disorders. I had no support system‚Äîneither from my family nor caregivers. I had to summon every ounce of strength to seek help on my own, despite my collapsed executive function. Periodic visits to the psychiatrist were beyond my capability. It was sheer hell.\n\nIn 14 years of struggle, my journey has been marked by phases. The first three years were spent in denial. The next two were devoted to understanding my diagnosis. Then came three more years of grappling with my unique comorbidities, which made my treatment profile exceptionally complicated. Finally, I spent the following years identifying treatments that worked for me.\n\nWith no support or guidance, I turned to self-diagnosis‚Äîpouring over psychiatry books and articles, often getting it wrong, but refining my understanding over time. I questioned every gap in my theories, relentlessly seeking answers. I experimented with various combinations of medications: SSRIs, SNRIs, benzodiazepines, and stimulants, each in an attempt to address my specific comorbidities. I failed repeatedly. But I kept trying.\n\nAfter 14 long years, I can now write this paragraph‚Äîa feat that would have been impossible in the past. Just organizing my thoughts to this extent would have been beyond me. And I‚Äôm not exaggerating in the slightest. In fact, I feel like my words still fall short of fully capturing the extent of my struggle.\n\nADHD has devastated my life. But it has also taught me lessons, given me experiences, and left me with stories to share. Starting now, I plan to share them here."

And apparently in people with ADHD, poor interoception can be pretty common.

I‚Äôve been taking it since I was 7 years old (25 now) and it always worked as you describe because I only took it a couple times a week and and I didn‚Äôt get tolerated to it. Once I went to university at 22 and I started taking it every day, something changed after a year or two. I used to be fine with 10 mg a day, now I take 60 mg, and like someone already commented on this post: it just doesn‚Äôt feel the same anymore.. Conclusion: let yourself raw dog a few days a week and/or during the weekends, and you‚Äôll probably continue to do all your work on days you‚Äôre taking it. Take care!"

Obviously I don't know where you're from so everywhere may be different, but keep an eye on your blood pressure and make sure you try to maintain your weight. Drs are ridiculously strict with this medication in the UK, I've been told if I go under a certain weight in this first month of taking Ritalin I have to stop the medication!

It‚Äôs very unusual you‚Äôd feel nothing when starting Ritalin at 10mg. **Check with your drs first** but I wonder if it would help to stagger the omeprazole and Ritalin so the Ritalin can be taken first (before a light breakfast), then an hour or two later take the omeprazole followed by a meal or snack as usual.

And listen to more talk radio or instrumental, taking the lyrics out of the inputs helps me too."

As someone who has been prescribed adderall and Vyvanse at different times, if I ever had caffiene with them, my heart rate would shoot up and almost trigger an anxiety attack. I had thoughts like \"Oh well I didn't get much sleep last night so my Vyvanse probably won't work as effectively, I'm sure caffiene wouldn't hurt!\" Nope.

We also noted a low overall risk (‚â§5%) of clinically significant cardiovascular events, including tachycardia or hypertension.\n\nFrom [Westover and Halm (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2261-12-41):\n\n>Findings of an association between prescription stimulant use and adverse cardiovascular outcomes are mixed. Studies of children and adolescents suggest that statistical power is limited in available study populations, and the absolute risk of an event is low. More suggestive of a safety signal, studies of adults found an increased risk for transient ischemic attack and sudden death/ventricular arrhythmia. Interpretation was limited due to differences in population, cardiovascular outcome selection/ascertainment, and methodology.\n\nOf course, this is just two papers out of many, but these papers suggest the risk is quite low."

All medication has side effects and stimulants can cause long-term complications They are life-saving medications for many people, but it is also true that others can manage their ADHD using therapy and exercise. \n\nMy view is that you shouldn‚Äôt be on medication for something you *can* manage without it, BUT you also need to objectively evaluate whether or not you truly are able to manage it effectively without medication. The same is true when it comes to increasing your dose btw! Your goal should be to stay on the lowest dose possible for the shortest amount of time **without sacrificing your overall quality of life.** No point in living a few extra years if you‚Äôre miserable!"

If you're 1 point off high BP and  meds increase BP by 1 point then it may be a problem. \n(Ik terminology is wrong and BP isnt one unit im soeaking hypothetically) \n\nBut if you're BP is thay high, then you need to worry about a lot more than just meds.

Most of the time children experience more severe side effects(which is why the dosage is usually smaller) and this is important because most of the data we have is on children. That said, raised blood pressure and heart rate aren't that common. One study took 736 teenagers taking methylphenidate(ritalin) and compared the results to a placebo group of 368.  12.2% of the methylphenidate group had elevated BP and 9.6% in the placebo group. Also the elevations in BP are usually small. If you're worried there are some things you can do like take magnesium, eat more fruits and veggies, replace your salt with a potassium based substitute(there are mixtures of potassium and sodium salt but there isn't a pure potassium salt), stop drinking coffee."

Starting with medication earlier on can actually help your brain grow better pathways because it's not stressed out, and make the ADHD symptoms less severe when older. ADHD and medication is one of the most studied \"disorders\" there is. It's heavily scrutinized.\n\nMy heart rate is a bit higher on medication, but without it my body is constantly exposed to my own, natural way more harmful chemicals like cortisol (stress) and messes with your own body's ability to regulate itself. ADHD medication is nothing different from any other medical treatment, and many medications started out \"natural\" but we learned to make the exact same thing ourselves so we didn't have to strip down entire rainforests for it. Literally the same molecules.\n\nAnd then we learned you can change that recipe a little and it does something similar, but different! Maybe better! (And sometimes worse, but that's why we have a need to do studies and apply the scientific method first!)\n\nI get the idea of it feeling scary because it's \"a chemical\", but I seriously mean it when I say raspberries are chemicals. The chemical v natural argument use the fact it kinda sounds like you're putting draino in your body to get you to buy *their* products. Even the organic \"no pesticides\" farmers use chemicals. And even pesticides! They just name them differently."

    "comment": "Research studies consistently show that the medications for ADHD are safe and effective and that untreated ADHD has  many negative consequences. The only health concern about them is that they shouldn't be used in someone known to have a co-existing cardiac condition. You can read evidenced-based summaries of these issues here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014976342100049X\n\nNote the more recent 32 studies that show that children, adolescents and young adults who take ADHD medications long-term have brain development that is closer to normal than those with ADHD who were never treated, known as neuroprotection. That is not to say that the medicines do not potentiate any side effects. They do. And they can be quite annoying. But they are not life threatening and there is no evidence of long term adverse effects for using these medications as prescribed for years at a time."

    "comment": "Hello! ADHD pharmacy student here with some fun facts!!!\n\n**ADHD has a high societal and economic burden.** We can do the math and find out that people with untreated ADHD have higher rates of unemployment, productivity loss, and increased healthcare costs (e.g. you're not on medication, so you get into more car accidents, emergencies or mental health crises). As such, **taking ADHD medication reduces the societal, financial, and emotional burden of ADHD.** You live a happier life with less crises, less late fees, etc. Think about how we prescribe drugs for high cholesterol and high blood pressure - long term, it reduces the chance for more catastrophic heart issues (e.g. stroke) and is really helpful in reducing total emotional, physical and cost burdens. \n\n**Stimulants have been proven safe in long-term studies. Higher blood pressure or heart rate is noted as one very common side effect, but long-term EKG changes or heart issues are not an issue**. Admittedly, there are a lack of good studies in this area because prescribers are comfortable prescribing stimulants long-term. Most of the studies follow up at around the 2 year mark, and are not super large (n = 100-200 ish). Again, this is because these drugs are highly effective have been available for a long time so pharma companies are less incentivized to do large, expensive long term studies. As ADHD gets diagnosed more, I expect to see more long-term cohort control studies in the future. \n\nThis is all to say that **we should be taking medication if we need it**. If you need them and they will lead to a better life for you, then whats the harm? It leads to better outcomes for you at work, in relationships, in day-to-day functioning, financially, and so much more. If my chemicals are out of balance, then why shouldn't I fix it with other chemicals? \n\n**My family members don't like taking medications for their blood pressure and cholesterol,** because **'I'd rather manage it naturally, it's too many chemicals'.** They change their tune very quickly when I show them large studies showing decreased stroke, heart attacks, and deaths in people who take medications long-term. \n\nHere are studies on the cost-effectiveness of stimulants (comparing healthcare costs in medicated vs non-medicated). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1180839/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1180839/)\n\nHere is a study on the total economic burden of ADHD in a society. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34806909/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34806909/) \n\nHere is a study on long-term safety and efficacy done in adults. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33017854/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33017854/)\n\nA couple more safety studies in children and/or adolescent populations. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36958362/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36958362/) \n\nAnd here is a **meta analysis** on safety and efficacy ADHD meds. These are the best of the best studies - they take data from as many studies as they can find, combine it, then analyze it as a whole.

I'm so hypersensitive to any sign of anxiety in my body, that I'd instantly trigger my panic even more.\n\nThe neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine, that are either increased or the reuptake inhibited by medication, play a role in the relationship of the frontal lobe and the amygdala, which is responsible for the fight and flight response. The stimulants should balance that relationship, so stress should actually decrease."

When i search through literature though it seems there is an association with ADHD and Alzheimer's in some form, like this one: [https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/alz.12462](https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/alz.12462)\n\nThat doesn't say anything about if stimulant treatment will change the Alzheimers risk though. But they suggest in the discussion that since ADHD correlates with substance abuse, physical injury and low educational achievement, the added risk could come from ADHD related behaviors.\n\nThe sort of overarching conclusion i've come to when i started searching around is that low dose methylphenidate (concerta, ritalin, medikinet etc.) is absolutely safe long term, and even the higher doses seem to be so as well. Personally, my blood pressure is unaffected by the dose i'm on (which is on the lower end). In fact, long term it will probably lower it due to the secondary effect of being able to exercise more and eat less."

    "comment": "I would imagine the true reality is impossible to determine, hence why a causal factor cannot, and probably will not, ever be determined.\n\nYour hunch would also be impossible to prove because there is no way to compare the results of both situations. If someone is medicated, you will never know how long they could have lived without it, and if unmedicated, you cannot know how long they would have lived if medicated.\n\nSo, say one with ADHD gets in some kind of accident due to being distracted. Well, did ADHD cause the accident? That‚Äôs pretty damn hard to discern. Every human is capable of being distracted, and distractions lead to all kinds of accidents. \n\nI would need to review the research again, but there are so many variables that can factor into an accident. Take driving for example, inclement weather, sleep deprivation, animals, substance use, mechanical issues, etc.. I highly doubt the research investigated the circumstances surrounding every single accident in their reviews involving a person with ADHD in an accident.\n\nRationally, it makes sense that ADHD => More Distractions and More Distractions => More accidents, but that does not mean ADHD = More accidents. \n\nOf course, this type of data is usually compared against other populations, but proving causality is still not possible.\n\nFor example, hot chocolate is drank more frequently in cold weather. There are more accidents in cold weather. But it would be weird (and incorrect) to say hot chocolate causes more accidents. It would correct to say there might be a positive correlation between hot chocolate and accidents in the winter."

My key advice, from my experience, is try not to get attached to labels, be open to where your symptoms/reactions take you, and don't get hung up on whatever is working for you is 'supposed' to treat - a lot of us have a well mixed psychological cocktail to work with, and it's no use trying to guess which order the ingredients came in, as long as you know what they are!\nI also have MDD - I am convinced if I was treated for ADHD first, I would have had a much easier path discussing and managing my depression - but it wasn't until I got my depression medicated correctly that I was able to clearly identify and seek my ADHD diagnosis. I spent over a decade being passed around and trying combos of meds, met my new Psychiatrist once and he agreed to prescribe me an atypical antidepressant - felt like a new person within days - completely turned my life around within a year."

It didn't feel like I was high or euphoric, but all of those little things that were usually a struggle became straightforward. If I saw something on the floor, I would just pick it up. I'd get out of bed on time. I wouldn't get sucked into doomscrolling on my phone, etc. \n\nAbout two months in or so, the effects definitely diminished. The Wellbutrin still helps me a lot, but it's not like it was those first two months and it was definitely disappointing when it happened. \n\n I mention this not to rain on your parade (and it might not even apply to you), but just to help you set your expectations."

It‚Äôs not common to feel a huge difference, and most meds take around 2-6 weeks for improvement of motivation, enjoyment of life, hopelessness or feeling sad, and most improvements people tend to notice are usually side effects masked as improving such as restlessness, bursts of energy, and feeling more alert and can sometimes subside or shift into insomnia or agitation. It could also be a sign of mania, sounds very much like those symptoms. If you talk to your doc and they give you the thumbs up, I wouldn‚Äôt worry about that though. It is also possible that it IS working, some people are just more sensitive than others, which is why it‚Äôs important to relay this info to your doctor who can keep track of mood shifts and the timing based on when you started meds. I wish you all the luck my friend, and as someone with adhd who has a hard time starting tasks, I‚Äôm proud of you!"

It was very helpful with many of my symptoms but not as helpful as the stimulant I am currently on (Vvyanse). Wellbutrin and Strattera (a non stimulant ADHD meds) combined together was very helpful as well but was a bit hard on my cardiovascular system. It was also hard to eat on that combo so I lost weight unintentionally."

    "comment": "Unfortunately Wellbutrin gave me headaches and tremors like mad, and other stimulant alternatives haven't really worked 100% for me. Adderall has always been great on my motivation and social anxiety, as well as my inability to regulate my impulse control it is a life saver. I regularly make better choices when on it, I can think through things in a much quicker manner to allow myself to make the right decisions.¬†\n\n\nBefore I started taking Adderall I would have dozens of scattered thoughts and be left with social and life choice indecisiveness that plagued my ability to do anything, so either I didn't or I did what was easiest or what would give me that rush.¬†\n\n\nSomething fun always seemed to be the way to go because normal every day tasks seemed not only just not be the right choice in my mind but drudging and depressing if I did, I would get angry about having to actually do my dishes (which I mean nobody likes dishes but it's gotta be done) and these things would put me in a depression as most tasks people dont like to do have to be done over and over and seem to have no point.¬†\n\n\nSo I never got anything done, and quickly my life spiraled out of control in many ways. I lost my jobs many times, I lost friendships, I went to jail, I moved across the country twice instead of facing the music.¬†\n\n\nCurrently I'm at a point where I am at odds with this prescription, I take 15 mgs and it doesn't seem to do anything for me anymore, and I've moved up from 5mgs to 15 over 7 months, I had recently stop taking it when their was a shortage, life went to hell to say the least, and I'm afraid I am either just going to be stuck going up every time it doesn't work, until I hit the top and then it doesn't work there either, or my doctor is just going to stop upping my doses until I find the right fit, or just no longer prescribe them to me, because he asked me if I was abusing it, I told him no(I am not), and that his question concerned me because I'm not, and told him why.¬†\n\n\nIt lead to a disagreement, then he stated he was going to give me a referral to another doctor, like to transfer me to someone elses care, but it's like, I take this medication to help regulate my impulse control, and it's not doing what it's supposed to, and now when I ask for the dosage to be upped and we get into a disagreement because its not working the way it should, you give me a give me a hard time? I just don't get it. It's not like I'm some punk kid either, I had been taking this medication for years and stopped taking it when the adderall shortage happened, and was at a higher dose, but now it's a problem to get me back to that? Huh...¬†\n\n\nSo adderall and stimulants aren't exactly all they are cracked up to be, they are wonderful when they work yes, but it's a slippery slope that I feel needs to be figured out. If there was a way to reverse someone's tolerance to drugs like this it would make them safer and more effective, this would help people for the duration of their lives rather than being looked down upon and shamed when they want something they know will work."

Also to me, it might sound silly, but I felt like I became dumber. I felt that way because I was in my head a lot less than I usually was (BY A LOT), and what was crazy is that certain things didn't bother me as much, like how I felt about my weight and body. I was 5'9\" 165lbs feeling like I was obese, but after being on Wellbutrin for a bit, I no longer felt that way. I also for the most part didn't care how others would perceive my body. It was a strange feeling.\n\n  \nNow... Wellbutrin did not solve all of my problems. I had issues working remotely, and Wellbutrin helped to some extent, but it wasn't great.

People with stimulant prescriptions routinely forget to take them, and recently we've been running out of them for days or weeks at a time with no ill effects other than the return of symptoms.

Yes it is older and the positives to it are that it is part of years of medical studies and it is one that is proven to be effective as well. Result is that there is a TON of science behind it. Because it is older we know more about the safety of it and the effects to the body (througout the years, however we do miss very long cohort studies, that wil come as time passes). So it in the current year of 2023 it is the first choice for effectiveness, safety and understanding. We simply know more about it and that makes it also 'safer' to prescribe it to patients."

    "comment": "When I used to prescribe ADHD meds I found more than half of my patients responded better to the amphetamines. Some of them had been stuck on methylphenidate for years with inadequate effect and were never tried on the amphetamines. When I switched them over to Elvanse they lit up. It was such a shame because in the meantime they‚Äôd been failing, becoming more and more depressed and insular. I worked at a private clinic and the aim was to get our patients to shared care with their GP and even though it is unsaid, sending them there with a script for Elvanse would be more likely to provoke push back due to the massive price difference. Each prescribing authority has their own formulary for ADHD meds which you can find if you dig around the internet so unfortunately, sometimes we‚Äôd have to take that into account with our prescribing decisions so if methylphenidate had some positive effect we‚Äôd stop there. Some people do respond very well to it though. \n\nI found also that methylphenidate can cause gastric issues in some people due to the way it is absorbed. There‚Äôs another couple of medications called Modafinil and Bupropion which were not on our formulary unfortunately and I‚Äôd liked to have tried those."

It has a fairly low potential for abuse because you can‚Äôt snort or inject it and that‚Äôs a big plus because patients with ADHD often struggle with substance abuse. But you can also add a short acting methylphenidate on top of the Elvanse. If both are not working you can get a special prescription for Amphetamin juice that a pharmacy has to produce for you, this naturally has a higher potential for abuse though and is only used when other treatments have failed. You can also get a prescription for medicinal THC. All of the above require a special narcotics prescription that is a government issued prescription that requires a diagnosis from a special doctor. But if you have the diagnosis the doctor will work with you on an individual level to find out what works best for you and assists you with getting therapy usually psychotherapy and ergo therapy are both used simultaneously. \nBuuuuuuuut: getting an appointment with such a qualified expert takes forever waiting lists are usually 1-2 years if they accept new patients at all. You could also get a private diagnosis that you have to pay for yourself but this will coast you hundreds of euros or more."

Neither Elvanse nor Adderall are available here.\n\nI‚Äôve been remotely seeing a German/American family medicine doctor who mails me a script for 3 months of Elvanse at a time, and then I drive over to Dresden to fill the script. Originally I was flying to Frankfurt and renting a car to see him in person and then fill the script the same day before flying back. So the move to telehealth has been a major improvement, even though I have to fill the script within 7 days of it being written, and it usually arrives after 5 days‚Ä¶.\n\nI was on a fairly high dose of Adderall for years before leaving the US. Ideally I‚Äôd still be on that, but  it‚Äôs much simpler to not fight the current more than necessary and just get the Elvanse.\n\nSo yes, there‚Äôs a definite preference towards Ritalin, its derivatives, and non-stimulants, and that‚Äôs probably almost entirely due to the stigma around anything with the word ‚Äúamphetamine‚Äù in it, given how little separation there is between Adderall and Ritalin. From what I can tell though, Elvanse is available in much of northern, western, and southern Europe."

Despite a continuous rise in diagnoses and waiting times (we're not that far off of two years), the number of licences is not increased (proportionately).

There are so many factors that can affect growth, it's difficult to properly research. I had stunted growth from birth due to having been born too early that affected the development of my entire body, to add to the factors of stunted growth. Genetics, environment and lots of other things can affect it.  \nSeeing as some of my friends who have been on those meds their entire life and are one of the tallest, it's clear why it's still a suspicion and not a fact. I actually got more hungry on the meds as my ADHD caused a very delayed signaling of when I was hungry and needed food, I had a phase of first getting slowly weaker before I would actually feel hungry (I learned to use the weaken phase as the signal to go get food before I got medicated, at least). It differs for each person and that makes it difficult.  \n\n\nMy psychiatric nurse at ADHD Centraal and me were actually very happy I responded very well to methylphenidate. So I'm a bit surprised to hearing yours wishes to skip it. I just see it as a \"if xyz doesn't work, try abc next\". Like, every person responds differently to each type of stimulation meds (just like coffee make one relaxed and calm, but anxious and nervous for another)."

I think it has to do a lot with the education and understanding of the general public for ADHD and it‚Äôs severity as well as a corresponding change in the healthcare systems attitude about the seriousness of ADHD and the suffering it can cause if untreated. It wasn‚Äôt until 2011 that adult ADHD was even considered a real illness in Germany and all prescriptions and therapy for adults had to be done off label and paid for privately and especially the cost of therapy made it financially unviable for most patients. Nowadays it‚Äôs all covered by the public health care system. For Elvanse for example the list price in Germany (varies greatly from country to country because the governments are bargaining with the drug company‚Äôs for a lower price) 78‚Ç¨. As someone with a public insurance I have to pay 10% of the list price the rest is covered by the insurance, the minimum copayment is 5‚Ç¨ and the maximum is 10‚Ç¨. So that means I only have to pay 7,80‚Ç¨ for my medication."

If I could take the elvanse in the morning and then take one regular Adderall in the afternoon, that would probably be the best scenario, but I‚Äôve only ever been on elvanse as a replacement for adderall, not concurrently with it.\n\nThe amphetamines vs Ritalin: They both dry my eyes a bit, so I usually keep contact solution handy. Ritalin though, seemed a little less effective generally, and it had the unfortunate side effect of inducing the physical sensations of anxiety even when I wasn‚Äôt actually anxious - heart pounding, limbs tingling, etc., for example if I was running a few minutes late to work or similar. I didn‚Äôt realize how much of a toll that took over time until I switched back to Adderall. None of the amphetamines, besides the mildly drier eyes I‚Äôd say, have any noticeable side effects for me. \n\nI‚Äôm not a chemist so I can‚Äôt speak to molecular differences, only that I‚Äôve been told that their structures don‚Äôt differ particularly much from each other, but certainly enough to be different compounds.

Thanks for the info. I was just going down the lines of taking more etc. Still remember being a space cadet on my first dose of Elvanse that I never had to the same degree with methylphenidate (instant or slow release)\n\nThere is definitely a cost implication with the NHS which is why they'll also start on the cheaper instant release methylphenidate (forgot the brand name) before trying the slightly more expensive Concerta.\n\nI found more positive effects & less side effects with Elvanse personally. It also feels less harsh on the body."

The dosage of the active ingredient (for ritalin that would be methylphenidat) is exactly the same. The only possible differences in the medication are the colouring used as well as any fillers. Besides allergies and just general preference, I can't think of any reason to not buy generic. \n\nI do sometimes get the not-cheapest generic version, because I prefer their packaging (some blister packaging can be absolute bullshit to open), but I never buy brand name for prescription medication if a generic option is available.\n\nIn Denmark it is the norm to a point where it is assumed you buy generic.

After the diagnosis, which came as a slight surprise to me, I learned a lot of things that helped me manage my symptoms. There was a waiting period before I was able to try medication, but even before that, just the knowledge had helped me a lot, so I was excited when I was finally able to try meds. And then‚Ä¶ they did absolutely nothing for me. Ritalin, Concerta, Vyvanse, all of them did nothing. I haven‚Äôt figured that out yet, and I‚Äôm a little bummed but it‚Äôs not a huge deal. Because the fact that the diagnosis answered so many of my questions and taught me some coping mechanisms was incredibly helpful on its own. But my point is that your diagnosis shouldn‚Äôt be based on your response to medication. Because when Ritalin and others did not work on me, I was *not* told ‚Äúoops maybe we diagnosed you wrong then.‚Äù Cuz that‚Äôs not how it works. If you feel like your symptoms align well with ADHD, then there‚Äôs a good chance that‚Äôs what you have. It took so long for me to figure out because my GP just kept saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs depression‚Äù but that really didn‚Äôt fit the bill entirely well for me. Learning about ADHD was a game changer. The medication issue is still a mystery to me, but let‚Äôs be honest: medication on a whole is still a mystery, even to scientists.

Some people will have a high or low amount of one or more of these drug metabolizing enzymes and you might need a low dose or very high dose depending on if the drug is active and the enzyme breaks it down, or if the drug needs the enzyme to activate the effective metabolite. \n\nFor example I can take the highest dose of Strattera and have zero effect - I mean nothing not even any side effects.

I have no idea why, it is also used to help people stop smoking, so I guess it can help with impulses. It has helped level out my mood as well. \n\nI still have bad days with a lot of brain fog, but it is something. Obviously, only you can say if it works for you, but don‚Äôt write it off as ‚Äònot an ADHD med‚Äô as lots of us find it effective. \n\nStrattea worked slightly better, but I had the rare side effect of constant tachycardia and my doctor said it was too dangerous. \n\nI was misdiagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, and none of those meds helped. Made things worse if anything."

    "comment": "To be fair.. I have to agree that if they did the full neuropsych evaluation, including the TOVA tests (the computer one), and you‚Äôre not responding to any ADHD medication.. the reality is you likely don‚Äôt have it. Impulsivity is not strictly a symptom of ADHD.. it falls under many other conditions! What did the results of that evaluation indicate diagnosis wise? A lot of other conditions can present as ADHD but aren‚Äôt.. but also vice versa! The cognitive testing that you went through is what helps determine whether symptoms are caused by attention deficit or other causes. It seems like you scored well attention and focus wise.. so it‚Äôs difficult for them to justify attention deficit if you didn‚Äôt display it during the testing.. especially the TOVA test that actually measures your right and wrong responses as well as your response speed. It provides actual scoring as to how well you pay attention.. and it‚Äôs normal for anyone to not be perfect.. but it‚Äôs the degree of distraction that indicates whether it‚Äôs an attention deficit or not! \n\nYou can always get a second test done with another psychologist to get a second opinion.. however they‚Äôll do the same tests. They‚Äôre all standard tests used across the board to diagnose.. so it won‚Äôt be much different!"

The main difference is that your mood changes for a reason, and you take it to the extreme. It's emotional disregulation but more complex. Like I'm angry and irritable all the time over the simplest things. I react immediately, and my first thought is to rip someone's head off. I have to stop myself and realize what's happening in a split second. 90% of the time, it's a me issue. I misinterpret or overreacted. It's mostly due to triggers from trauma. The worst bpd thing is a favorite person. I almost ruined my marriage twice. But I digress, I have limited understanding of bipolar 1 & 2.

ADHD medication can really help in social situations because this disorder doesn‚Äôt just affect school or work‚Äîit goes beyond that.\n\nIn my case, it‚Äôs funny because when I‚Äôm medicated, I end up talking to a ton of people. But later, I suddenly shut down, hahaha. I ask myself, ‚ÄúWhy did I invite 30 friends to hang out, and now I can‚Äôt even get out of bed? That's a really funny situation."

Now I just instantly respond to them, or if I can't respond to them in the moment I actually respond as soon as I can.\n\nI also feel more talkative, especially because I used to overthink too much about what to say.

I have a weekly schedule for the days I take my ADHD meds and its based on my school work and job. So every week i‚Äôll take my meds Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and sometimes Sunday if I push off my weekly assignments to the last day. I dont take my meds on Monday‚Äôs, Tuesday‚Äôs, Saturday‚Äôs, and sometimes Sunday‚Äôs. I know taking days off can be rough but I firmly believe the pro‚Äôs out weigh the cons in the long run with taking stimulant meds. I notice with this schedule my meds feel more effective on a weekly basis because of the days I take off every week, it helps prevent tolerance buildup, so I havnt felt like I needed a higher dosage and another plus I have extra after every month which is helpful with the current shortage. Another thing I notice is on my days off I still feel capable of getting through my day.  Without feeling like im dragging a 500 pound weight everywhere, unmotivated, fatigued, depressed, similar to what OP described. Dependency is normal with every medication that is taken daily. its not a bad thing by any means when taken as prescribed. But after trying many different Adhd meds over the past 5 years while taking them 6 or 7 days every single week it did more harm to my overall mental health in the long run. I also consistently felt like my dosage was not high enough. That cycle repeated for a while until I set up that schedule for myself. \n\nSorry about the length of my post, I just think its really important to educate people that even though ADHD meds are lifesaver‚Äôs for us they can sometimes cause a negative impact for one‚Äôs mental health if taken daily.\n\nEdit: I realize This is topic varies in opinion from person to person. This is just my experience and how ive found the best results with my meds since being diagnosed  back in 2018"

I've been on Concerta 27mg for about 3 months and have really just been feeling diminishing returns but my doctor just interprets it as if I'm not trying hard enough and refuses to increase it or offer any other help because she's worried about tolerance and capping it too soon. \n\nI don't have side effects, my appetite feels fine and I don't feel when it kicks in as I don't feel too much different, everything feels like pulling teeth, my social anxiety at work makes talking and feeling comfortable hard and decision paralysis/executive dysfunction are the worst. \n\nI'm really glad you have that clarity to know your meds are working and your new normal has been going really well for you that you notice such a huge difference on days you don't take your dose!! I'm sorry I didn't mean to ramble on about myself that much tho!!"

I'm basically useless that day. Sometimes I just don't have the time in my schedule to spend an entire day doing nothing, but I try to make room for it. I just think of it as a rest day. I sit around with my husband, watch movies all day and nap. Maybe go for a walk, but mostly i dont expect much from myself that day. It's not ideal, but this is the hand I was dealt. If I was diabetic I wouldn't be able to eat that slice of cake. If I had kidney disease I would have to spend time on dialysis. As far as health issues go.. having to do a lazy TV day a few times a month as part of the management of my ADHD is not too bad.\n\nI also think the bounce back after regularly being on meds is tougher BECAUSE you're body is adjusted to them. I DEFINITELY struggle without my meds, but I'm not sure it's fair to compare myself one day off of meds to my medicated self. \n\nA fairer comparison would be me 2-3 weeks off of meds vs. medicated. 2 weeks off of meds I'm scatter brained, unfocused, procrastinating, fidgety, it takes me forever do things because i get distracted, etc. But I'm not sluggish the way I am the first day off. Part of my unmedicated symptoms are that my thoughts jump around... a lot. I can't shut my brain off. My thoughts are always going a mile a minute to the point where I can't sleep because I can't stop thinking. It's exhausting. First day off of meds I don't have that problem. If anything, my brain is slower. 2-3 weeks of the meds and that shit is back in full force."

I notice if I skip completely for 1-2days , it takes me at least the 2nd or 3rd day of resuming to mentally get back to the ‚Äúdrivers seat‚Äù. \n3) tolerance breaks are good, mostly bc we can‚Äôt rely on the supply the same way as say with blood pressure meds, but also spiritually it‚Äôs an opportunity to take a humble break \n4) to gamify tolerance breaks by willing myself to do the ‚Äúeasiest‚Äù things, like waking up and go straight out around the block for a walk bc if I hesitate for a second I won‚Äôt know what to change into/ if I should eat breakfast/which morning/hygiene routine to do first.

I think the general idea which I haven‚Äôt seen here, is finding the minimum dose that makes things better.\n\nOnce you are adjusted to a dose, you won‚Äôt feel as ‚Äúgreat‚Äù as you did in the beginning. I think this is where people search for a higher dose.  Without knowing it, I think a lot of people are ‚Äúchasing a high.‚Äù"

I wouldn‚Äôt rush into adjusting your dose. The effect might vary, just like our symptoms do. Sleep, food, stress, workload etc all have an impact. And for females the monthly hormonal cycle often makes a huge difference in how well the meds work. Last couple weeks of my cycle I often function significantly worse. Some people take a slightly higher dose in this time. Hope it keeps working well for you!"

But take a day off when you actually have nothing to do. Relax if you can. Communicate with your partner and let them or other family know you're taking a day off. Really just relax and eat and meditate. It gets so much easier by the third time of taking a day off. My Dr suggested even try one day on one day off. \n\nHope that helps!! Think positive guys!

Getting off though was a huge struggle. HUGE. I was really addicted.\n\nYou described needing a higher dose already. That is what happens. You slowly need more. By the end I was on 60mg twice per day (!!) and I thought it was completely normal. I freaking loved it at the time. But it came with a huge cost. I was hyper productive, unable to chill, obsessed with getting things done.\n\nEventually I went into psychosis after trying to ween off, but then going back to my original dose because I was craving it so bad. After battling mania/psychosis for a few months, I finally kicked the habit and now I‚Äôm clean and I love it.\n\nLife without vyvanse has been revolutionary for me. No, I‚Äôm not hyper productive, but I can still get locked in and get things done.\n\nTL:DR; I‚Äôm typing this because I don‚Äôt want to see others become addicted to Vyvanse like I was.

This is leaving out the actual side effects of getting insatiable hunger and unlike me anger in the evenings when on it. I went through that and then asked to switch to vyvanse and give it a try.

For what it's worth, when I first took Adderall and Vyvanse I had similar side effects and then after like two weeks the side effects either became like a lottt weaker or completely disappeared. I rarely get headaches, never got blurred visions though, and it hardly affects my appetite anymore. I used to get really tired when it wore off but that doesn't happen anymore at all. I found that taking it on the weekends when I didn't work was still helpful like spending less money when I shopped, less mistakes when driving, and a better listener when my partner talked to me. The only reason I don't take it on the weekends now is bc after a little under two years I learned I quickly develop a tolerance and the highest dose did nothing. My work performance suffered a lot and then my mental health crumbled bc of it and I had to take a very long medical leave/drug vacation. That's not the case for everyone. Some ppl take it years and years and barely develop a tolerance if at all. If that were the case for me I'd definitely take it on the weekend bc ADHD affects every part of your life, not just school or work. I remember crying when I realized how much easier reading for fun was when I took ADHD. When I tried to do it without meds for the first time I felt so dumb and that's when I cried.

Just fill a measuring cup with the same amount of milliliters as the amount of milligrams of the capsule, then open the capsule and pour all the powder in. Then mix it and take out whatever milliliters you want the dose to be. E.g. if you have 70mg capsules and want a 50mg dose, mix the powder with 70mls of water and then take out 50mls and drink that. This advice was given to a lot of people here during the shortage of Vyvanse because the 70mg was still available, so they'd be prescribed the 70mg and then take whatever dosage they needed using the water dilution method."

I've I was told the name brand Vyvanse is now some kind of gell beads and can't/isn't easy to divide??\n\nAnyways, always best to consult with your prescribing professional about any dosing changes, etc. But being a controlled substance sometimes it seems they just have to reiterate the guidelines they are told they have to. In the US they will not prescribe be two on the same pill each day, was told that was against DEA rules.

Lisdexamfetamine (the generic drug in name brand Vyvanse is a somewhat slow release inherently because it's a \"prodrug\" and your body has to break off the lysine molecule attached to the lisdexamfetamine molecule to release the amphetamine molecule and that takes place over time. I believe the gel beads in name brand Vyvanse as described to me, never seen it with my own eyes are for additional slow release. Which I worry would be too slow? I need to take any lisdexamfetamine I take in a day first thing in the morning or getting to sleep can be quite problematic. And the effects are slow enough to kick in as it is, if not for a strong espresso first thing in the morning I'd be useless for hours waiting for the lisdexamfetamine to kick in enough."

For a time I was drinking daily while (on stimulants, but in the evening when they wore off) to help me study in grad school but it became unhealthy and now I drink only very occasionally socially (or not at all, given that I‚Äôve been pregnant/postpartum the past 20 months). I know there is an extraordinarily high propensity for alcohol use disorder among folks with ADHD especially when untreated so it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm also mindful of.\n\nI‚Äôve found high caffeine intake is a necessity off meds. On meds I still consume it but probably shouldn‚Äôt as it certainly increases side effects of stimulants.\n\nThat‚Äôs interesting about propranolol. I was on bisoprolol when I was in third trimester pregnancy because I had a POTS flare up (where your heart rate and blood pressure go wonky when standing or ping activities). I was on stimulants at the time but honestly can‚Äôt remember if it helped with the stimulants side effect besides maybe reducing heart rate (which is why I was taking it). It just made me feel very very tired. I know Guanaficine is used as a blood pressure med too but I think the mechanism of action is different.\n\nI‚Äôve not found any other meds/substances to be of much use. The only other mood targeting drug I‚Äôve been on is antidepressants and I haven‚Äôt needed these since I began stimulants 18 year ago - turns out my depression was just untreated ADHD, so treating that worked much better for my mood than trying to target my mood directly. I still found I got some anxiety and mood swings that were worsened on stimulants, and Intuniv helped stabilize my mood and decrease my ‚Äòstimulant anxiety‚Äô. At one point I also did a brief trial of non stimulants for adhd but they didn‚Äôt work for me.\n\nEdit to add: for me, the best mood boosting stimulant (ie to reduce feelings of sadness and low mood/depressed feelings) by far is dexederine. It‚Äôs otherwise not the ideal med for me as I get lots of side effects and yet I keep returning to it because I get that extra mood boost."

    "comment": "Thanks a lot for the detailed reply, much appreciated! I had a hunch alcohol might be working for you too, but it's a slippery slope for sure. I treat it as a last resort. From what I read the mechanisms at play there might lead to paying for it later the same way one does with taking benzos. \n\nI believe dexedrine is quite similar to vyvanse, but quicker acting and doesn't last as long.\n\nI found the propanolol helps quite well against \"stimulant anxiety\" for me, not just for lowering the heartrate back down. I can't really compare it to bisoprolol because I only took that once. Neither of them made me tired. \n\nCaffeine is a tricky one, I haven't quite figured out yet what the right dose is for me. At the moment I drink one instant coffee in the morning, which should be around 40 to 50mg of caffeine, and any more than that seems to be detrimental. E.g. pepsi already is too much. Before I was on the proper stimulants I was leaning quite heavily on caffeine, but I can't tell for sure whether that was just addiction or whether it actually helped."

    "comment": "For me, although they are relatively similar, dexedrine and vyvannse feel different enough in notable ways. I had to be on 70mg of vyvannse (max dose) and only 20mg on dexedrine (half the max dose) because I found vyvannse just didn‚Äôt give me the same buzzy ‚Äòget up and get going‚Äô initial stimulation that Dexedrine does. It lasts longer but takes longer to set in. I switch to it when I find things aren‚Äôt working as well for me with the dexedrine (meds switch up to reduce the tolerance) but always end up back on dex! \n\nAnd great to know about the propranolol. I may consider going back on a beta blocker if my heart rate starts spiking again. I just wish I didn‚Äôt get the fatigue, you are lucky that you don‚Äôt."

Talk to your doctor, by all means, but unless your BP is dangerously high, they may just tell you that you have to keep going for a week or two more and see what happens. \"A few days\" is not long enough to observe what effect the medication is going to have long term. Serious cardiac issues are not a common (or even *listed*) side effect of Ritalin, afaik.

So you slip yourself back into crazy land because it is where you have always been. \n\nTaking medication that does its job and helps you become mentally stable is the GOAL. Using the tried and true metaphor, if you have diabetes and your medication makes you able to live, does that mean you are addicted?  Throw away that addictive insulin‚Ä¶you should be able to control your blood sugar without it. I mean, what‚Äôs wrong with you?   /s. \n\nNeeding medication does NOT mean you have an addiction. It is the wonder of modern medicine.  And you are taking care of yourself. \n\nThe outside world says ANY substance that alters your mental state can NOT be healthy and you will get addicted to it.  Please let your inner rebel take over and tell them to mind their own business. It is ok to be ok."

I have combination adhd but my doctor said I leaned more inattentive. She was 100% positive I was combination type though. \n\nMy boyfriend has pretty severe ADHD and he was on 40 mg twice a day for years before he stopped taking it because he had hip surgery and never went back on. He‚Äôs been able to build enough of a routine that he sticks to that he no longer needs it at work and the two of us body double heavily at night so he‚Äôs fine without it for now (but suspects he may need to go back on some day, although he would like to try a lower dose.) \n\nSo unless you were on a way different version of Ritalin than I was your dosing seems super low to me. But I felt clear effects on 10 mg. It just wasn‚Äôt enough to get over my executive dysfunction hump consistently. So if you felt no benefits then yeah it‚Äôs probably not the right med.\n\nExtended release meds have never worked well for me.

    "comment": "Every body is different and there are other options that aren‚Äôt stimulants, or are other forms of those stimulants. There is a new medication that‚Äôs in the methylphenidate class called ‚ÄúAzstarys‚Äù which is both quick and long acting. There is lisdexamphetamine which is known as ‚Äúvyvanse‚Äù also. You may benefit more from a non-stimulant medication like guanfacine or atomoxatine. Some people do well on bupropion (Wellbutrin). Some people may not tolerate or respond to medications well. \n\nMedication may not be a fix for everyone, or it might be a tool in the toolbox, but you often need several tools right? There are therapists who specialize in adhd which involves both processing the emotions around having these symptoms and help building new systems that work with your brain and body. \n\nLastly, I know it‚Äôs a frustrating or scary consideration, but could you possibly be misdiagnosed? This doesn‚Äôt make the symptoms you feel less devastating, but the end goal is to make sure you feel better right? A lot of adhd symptoms overlap with other issues! Executive function, attention span, organization, and short-term memory are often the first things to go when you‚Äôre stressed. \n\nThis doesn‚Äôt mean you aren‚Äôt feeling these issues, it doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt have adhd, but there might be a different root cause for your symptoms!"

I have a friend who‚Äôs doing really well with their ADHD on a high dose of just wellbutrin though. For me, it‚Äôs the combo of wellbutrin + adderall that I‚Äôm on now that‚Äôs working best.

I have to be careful to stay farrrr away from caffeine on days I take the adderall, and usually end up working out before bed to get the last of the jitters out.

Metadate and Concerta are methylphenidate-based medications like Ritalin.\n\nWelbutrin made me angry when I was going up or down in dosage. I was on it briefly before being diagnosed with ADHD (I took it for fatigue issues that my doc thought was depression-related). It made me feel the best and my ADHD symptoms were alleviated very well, but it also gave me severe memory and brain fog issues even on low doses. I couldn't last more than a couple of months on it. The memory and brain fog issues lasted for several months after I titrated off.\n\nI took Metadate ER (or whatever the extended release was called) after diagnosis. It hit noticeably, but wore off noticeably. My anxiety rebounded very hard once it wore off for the day. It made evenings very rough for me overall.\n\nI recently switched to Concerta ER (or whatever the extended release is called). It's been super subtle, but I've had no side effects to complain about. It's just very difficult to tell how well it's working. I still like it a lot better than Metadate.\n\nI really do wish Welbutrin didn't give me those cognitive side effects.

It has taken away my anxiety completely to the point where I went from strong anxiety meds twice a day to... Zero anxiety meds, at all. I feel like I have more positive emotions, I've noticed I'm happy stimming quite often and that's usually a sign that I'm very very happy and upbeat. I definitely feel more joy because I can do stuff now without sitting in paralysis and that makes me pleased and satisfied with both myself and my life and my environment. I've not lost my creativity either (which can be seen by the art I still very much do). \n\nThe problem with medication like that is that our brains are all different. The posts you read on tiktok was from people whose brain reacted negatively to the drug but you won't know if that applies to you or not unless you try the drug yourself. Your brain is an unique piece of natural art and nobody can predict how it will react to medication. \n\nThe good thing about Ritalin / Medikinet is that it is out of your system fast. Mine stops working after 5 hours at the max. So if you notice that you suddenly lack emotions and are more anxious you can simply stop taking it and ask about alternative medication. But you have to try it. Medikinet made my life so much better to the point where my biggest wish is that I would've gotten it as a child. What I could have achieved! \n\nThis medication saved me from my own brain. Give it a chance, maybe it will save you too."

When I start taking it usually there is a 1-2 week adjustment period where I do feel emotionally numb, robotic, and out of myself. Social interactions are difficult during this time because I lose the spontaneity and creativity of my ADHD that I rely on to interact with others. I tend to isolate myself while I'm in that process. \n\nThis robotic feeling does go away slightly after some time. It never goes away altogether. I think you just kind of get used to it. \n\nI've never been able to continue taking the medication for more than a couple months at a time, cause I do find that I lose myself in work and things get a bit less exciting. I start getting burnt out. I give myself weekend breaks to let my brain run loose and just enjoy having ADHD. I just use the medication when I feel like i'm getting overwhelmed with responsibilities and my mind just won't cooperate. \n\nThat's just my experience of course, and it might be different for you."

So if it's a bad experience, that's awful, but you need to get through the day, and then you can move on.

This way you don't have other stressors that could confuse the results of the medicine. When approaching meds I think about \"what's the worst that is likely to happen?\" Videos are usually made to show extreme results (good and bad) and don't show results of millions who have taken each med successfully. Some of these meds have been around for 20 or 40 years so there is lots of legit NIH info on them. I find that follow up reading, including what is in the med and how does it affect my body as comforting.

I won't go higher than that unless its an all hands on deck situation where if I don't get something done life is going to suck.  Normally, just that need to get it done with such urgency is what fixes it and I don't need to take extra meds, but sometimes, I am overwhelmed and don't know where to start and if I could just GET GOING...maybe I could do what needs doing.\n\nYeah.

I‚Äôve encountered differences of about $10 from what good Rx says but usually pretty accurate.\n\nAlso, if pt is super, super responsible (docs don‚Äôt like do this), it might help for doc to overprescribe if the pricing calculation is done by Rx rather than by tablet.\n\nLast idea would be to work with doc to explore cheaper meds.\n\nThis is a tough situation.\n\nIMPORTANT: I‚Äôm not a licensed HCP anywhere in anything and am just someone on social media and could be talking out my butt.

If anyone doesn't know, prescriptions from any European country are valid in any other European country, but countries are allowed put some restrictions. And France does... There, the pharmacist can reject the prescription if they think you are faking it or if they think it can damage you.

When I started, the initial dose didn't do much, upped it, and just got side effects,  upped it again, and it started working. It takes time. Sometimes, one drug doesn't work for you, and you need to trial others. Be honest with your doctor about the effects and they will help you work out the best dose and drug. It took me about 12 months to get it about as good as it will get. \nJust remember,  it doesn't fix ADHD. It gives you a window to better fight the mess it makes of your life. You will need to get routines, alarms, etc to take full advantage of the meds. Don't think the meds fix the problem. They just give you a fighting chance to control your brain for a while. \nI knew they were working the first time when my head was quiet. You'll know when it happens. Just be aware of the come down. If you are on the short acting, it will take up to 30 minutes to kick in and about 3 hours after that you will start to come down. You can feel edgy, jittery then, so be careful interacting with others. After a while, you should get less side effects as you get used to it. Heart rate and blood pressure will also jump up, but that will settle a bit with time as well. \nGood luck!"

When you have your med review with your treating professional you should definitely talk about it. They should have more options available for you to try.\n\nI'm on Vyvanse (50mg) and I don't have quiet in my brain (music all the time, constant internal monologue) but I _do_ have focus - and that's what I need more than anything else."

    "comment": "As someone who partied with the ADHD meds a decade ago, I'll say that everyone is hysterical. Generic Adderall is still the same stuff it was on 2013 when I was in college. Idk why people during COVID decided all the meds were tampered with, or lost efficacy. I myself was put on Adderall recently, and while on medicinal dose, I don't \"feel\" anything, I notice that I am a lot more lucid, and if I put my mind to accomplishing something I'm more prone to actually following through. If I say, take both my pills in the morning though, yeah there's still the buzz there. My guess is COVID made people stir crazy and a bit hysterical with the supply shortage. Testing the pills has only shown that it's still amphetamine. Can't get the ratio of the blend each manufacturer does, but idk if you're expecting a buzz or rush, you aren't likely treating ADHD. Daily dosing is even not really suggested, but Ritalin is a bit different, and I've never taken it. So whatever, I can't speak on it, but I would stop reading reddit for med advice. Lots of quacks thinking there's some globalist conspiracy to dilute their meds and all. If you read enough you'll bias yourself into believing lots of honestly silly stuff.\n\nJust make sure that whatever drugs you take, if generic, are from American labs. We can at least for certain say they're 3rd party verified here in America, vs import meds that are analyzed in house and we just accept whoevers lab reports as good enough. If there is any fuckery with meds, I'd wager you'd be more likely to receive inferior product of your getting anything made by like Teva Jerusalem etc...i got Adderall from them that, while it didn't help me with anything, managed to wire me out, make me super irritable, etc...but a lot of folks here praise it. I just say talk to your Dr above anyone, give meds a chance to work without hyperfixating on it. If after a month you actually don't see any improvement talk with your doc, adjust dose, or try a different med."

Honestly the more I've looked into patents,lawsuits, weird AF prodrugs for drugs were in shortage of, and which manufacturer is from where in the world does really seem to have somewhat noticeably different effects. As skeptical as Ive tried to be, after trying so many different generics in a year now, all I can say is my personal opinion is there are a couple that are genuinely higher quality product all around, and also requires more transparent scrutiny than their competitors.

    "comment": "I am also an X-ray and CT Technologist and I agree with a lot of what you said. I knew I would languish in a desk job so that‚Äôs what drove me to this career. I just wanted a job that pays a living wage, that I could easily do overtime if I had to, that I could advance in if I wanted to, and made me think critically while working on my feet.\n\nContext matters though! For anybody considering this path there are certain things you must be ok with. Sure you will intern in a hospital, but hospitals vary greatly. Some are only doing street medicine plus outpatients, some get minor traumas, some do full blown TV drama traumas 24/7. Most people don‚Äôt realize just how differently equipped hospitals are and it will define the experience you get in school and what you feel comfortable doing in the long run. \n\nAfter you graduate and gain some working experience, you don‚Äôt have to work in a hospital necessarily. Purely outpatient environments, orthopedic/spine specialist offices, and non-ER Urgent care places exist but they‚Äôre harder to get into and have their own pros and cons. Again, there is a massive difference in the types of environments you can work in, so you need to have an open mind and be flexible enough to jump around until you find something you like. \n\nYou will be dealing with the general public for a living‚Ä¶ at their worst. They will have high expectations, be cruel to you, maybe even take a swing at you. Like Karen‚Äôs on crack, perhaps literally. You will get bodily fluids on you and you‚Äôre gonna learn how they all smell. Sick people will cough straight into your face and eyes with no regard for your health because ‚Äúyou signed up for this‚Äù. (Your immune system will also become godlike eventually).\n\nSome people assume you‚Äôre a button pusher taking pics of broken bones for a living. Did I mention you also deal with the whole alimentary canal? You‚Äôre gonna be giving people contrast enemas and making them drink stuff they‚Äôre likely to vomit back up while you‚Äôre trying to get your images üòµ‚Äçüí´. When we say you‚Äôll be working on your feet we mean you will be pushing, pulling, and lifting the most overweight, incapacitated people your brain can imagine likely without enough help. You are the sliding mechanism from bed to table and back again. Wear your good sneakers and stay limber. \n\nMedical imaging is the backbone of most diagnosis for many pathologies. You‚Äôll be dealing with EVERY SINGLE COVID patient (thank god those numbers have dwindled) and many other people with contagious diseases, respiratory issues, relentless diarrhea from antibiotic resistant organisms, embarrassing stuff, you name it. Whatever the next plague is, you‚Äôll be on the front lines of it right with the nurses, doctors, respiratory, tech partners, and other staff before you even know what the patient has. And a lot of the time they‚Äôll be unnecessary exams ordered by fresh residents still in school who have a lot to learn. \n\nThat being said, it checks a lot of boxes otherwise and is very stable work. I‚Äôve never felt the heat of a layoff because there‚Äôs no shortage of work. My coworkers are all grizzled people like me who share in the experience of having a front row seat to everything humanity has to offer. When you get past all the attention seekers and unnecessary stuff there are times where you play a vital role in life-saving care and that is very rewarding. \n\nThere are many positives, very dependent on your environment and type of patients. I just think it‚Äôs important to have the whole picture because people don‚Äôt realize what the job entails in it‚Äôs entirety and don‚Äôt fully think through what it‚Äôs like to be working with a sick and injured public as a regular thing. Wanting to help people is great, but you also need to protect yourself and there will be times when doing the right thing for your health results in a delay in patient care. A busy hospital setting is designed to juice you for every ounce of productivity you‚Äôre worth with stress and guilt (from patients waiting) as the catalyst. The stress used to be my fuel for focus and helped me thrive. That‚Äôs changed over the years and I‚Äôm happily in a much slower environment now. \n\nIf you stick to Xray and CT your time spent with a patient is minimal for the most part, probably not more than 20 min at a time at the max end. Other modalities can completely change your work dynamic/ time spent with patients and require some extra schooling and work training. With training/schooling there are niche branches you can go into like application management (for the machines), traveling medical device representative (for the OR), Image Archive Administration, management, teaching, other specifically hospital-related non-radiology things using your experience, etc. \n\nI am very happy I got to an experience level where I feel very useful in many situations. I love to solve problems. Sometimes you can put your extra effort into making the patient more comfortable, sometimes you need to be tough and do what needs to be done even though it makes them more uncomfortable so they can be treated properly. Some exams are scary and the field needs people who have compassion to help patients though a scary experience while still doing their job correctly.\n\nPhew! Didn‚Äôt realize I had that much to say!"

As someone who‚Äôs had a lot of health issues and has had many MRIs, I‚Äôm constantly hearing them say that Radiology Techs are in high demand. They are desperately needed in hospitals & imaging centers all across the country. \n\nGetting a good image is extremely important for a patient‚Äôs diagnosis and treatment plan, so you DO need to be incredibly focused when you‚Äôre taking the images‚Ä¶but it seems like it would only require short bursts of focus, because most scans don‚Äôt take very long. \n\nI would hate to have a tech who was distracted. The last time I got a CT, the ER doc came back in the room and said that it was inconclusive because ‚Äúthe scan is only as good as the tech who does it.‚Äù So I felt like I subjected my body to *more* radiation, and it was all for nothing, because the tech wasn‚Äôt precise, didn‚Äôt do it correctly, and we didn‚Äôt get any answers. That was really frustrating. So if anyone here does go into this field: you need to understand the importance of what you‚Äôre doing and have the ability to stay laser focused for the 10-20 minutes that each one takes to complete. \n\nThis could be a good option though for people who like healthcare and don‚Äôt want to go off to a 4 year university. I wish there were more jobs like this, where you could complete your formal education in ~2 years and get on the fast track to a specific career.

Sitting in front of a computer all day is sooo uncomfortable and even though I have a standing desk, and try to get up and move, it just sucks because everything I do requires being at the computer.\n\nAlso the work/life boundaries‚Ä¶ I really miss being able to leave work at work. When you work from home and can technically work whenever you want, it feels like you‚Äôre ALWAYS working üò™"

There is also travel X-ray, you work in one place for 3 months and then you can extend the contract or go to another place, or even take some time off! And if you can‚Äôt find a travel gig, the demand for pretty much every state is so high right now you can get a full time job just about anywhere. \n\nMuch easier than nursing, cool variety of exams, and you can work PRN, part time, full time, or a lot of places offer tons of OT so you can make some good money."

    "comment": "Not sure if I‚Äôm allowed to post the body I‚Äôm the comments, but I guess I‚Äôll try!\n\nI‚Äôve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share\n\n(Disclaimer: I am not any sort of recruiter and gain nothing financial from this posting. I‚Äôm just trying to share my experience in hopes that it can help someone like me.)\n\nI‚Äôm a 27yo female diagnosed with ADHD and started medication in 2021. I showed a ton of signs of ADHD as a child but was never diagnosed because I was good at masking/coping, but that‚Äôs a story for a different post.\n\nI was previously a teacher and did some social work. I loved the job but like my symptoms were awful in that career because of the lack of daily closure and endless deadlines.\n\nI will never stop talking about how perfect my career is for a brain like mine. And that career is radiologic technologist. If you don‚Äôt know what a rad tech is, they‚Äôre the people who take your x-rays, CTs, MRIs, and other medical imaging. \n\nHere‚Äôs why it‚Äôs perfect:\n\n-All rad techs (except ultrasound) start in x-ray, which is what I do. When you get bored with x-ray, there are tons of opportunities to cross train in MRI, CT, IR, cath lab, vascular IR, mammography, and lots more. I love knowing that when I inevitably become tired of X-ray, I can easily change fields without having to change my place of work. And if I want to leave, I can work in a variety of environments.\n\n-The instant gratification is incredible. There are no long term projects, no calendars full of deadlines, no long boring meetings. I x-ray a patient, get a small high when my images come out beautiful, I scan in like two papers, and then I send the patient on their merry way. If the patient is challenging, my brain is so happy to think outside the box and try different techniques to get things just perfect.\n\n-The job is constantly on the go, which I LOVE! \n\n-School is only two years and is very hands on. I struggle with lectures so this worked very well for me.\n\n-And best of all, no one judges me when I pound down my Ritalin with a Celsius because they‚Äôre all doing the same thing!\n\nI really hope this helps somebody!‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\nEDIT: Wow, I did not anticipate to wake up with this much attention to this post! I wanted to answer a few commonly asked questions that I‚Äôm seeing over and over:\n\n1. EDUCATION: A degree in X-ray which is where the majority of people start, is an Associate‚Äôs degree. I did the program in 20 months, which included a summer, and took most of my general education credits simultaneously. Several people in my graduating class did the program in three years so their gen eds were done ahead of time. There are Bachelors degrees but they‚Äôre not required. Some schools also offer 2+1 programs where you can graduate having done X-ray plus a modality. These are cool if you want to fast track yourself into a modality such as MRI or CT! While some modalities require a formal education, where I live most places will train the ones that don‚Äôt right on the job. I encourage those interested in a specific area to go to ARRT.org\n\n2. THE SCHOOLING IS NO JOKE: Although school is short, it‚Äôs not for the faint of heart. You do clinicals along with didactic courses, and then at the end, you have to take and pass a massive board exam to get a license. The time those things take are a big commitment. I was really passionate about it all so it wasn‚Äôt as hard for me as it was for others!\n\n3. SCHOOLING CAN BE FREE: I didn‚Äôt pay a penny to go back to school because I applied for every scholarship and every grant my community college offered. Hospitals need imaging professionals now more than ever so I know many hospitals are sponsoring students to go or offering massive amounts loan forgiveness.\n\n4. PAY: I have a hard time answering questions about pay because it is so variable depending on if you work in a hospital or outpatient setting, if you take call, if you work a shift with high premiums, etc. Most of all, it totally depend on what state you‚Äôre in! X-ray techs generally are paid the lowest, but if you can work somewhere that cross trains in other modalities, you can make a lot more. My MRI friends have base pays higher than the staff nurses at the hospital. \n\n5. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A TOUGH STOMACH: We see just as much as nurses/doctors if not more. Although I don‚Äôt generally have to clean patients, I do see open wounds and all of the bodily fluids. You also have to go to the OR during your schooling but you can find jobs that don‚Äôt require you to go to the OR. I have many friends in outpatient and they don‚Äôt deal with like any bodily fluids or super gross and sickly patients, but you do have to rotate through hospitals during school.\n\n6. AN ABILITY TO DISASSOCIATE IS A MUST: I have a very high level of empathy like many of us ADHDers do. At first, it was hard. A patient comes in for a scan worried their cancer has returned, and you do the scan and see that it has. We don‚Äôt diagnose so we can‚Äôt tell the patient, we just have to smile and go back in and talk to the patient. When I started, this sucked. But I direct my empathy towards taking care of their immediate needs like getting them a warm blanket or being a listening ear, and don‚Äôt really focus on the bad stuff. It happens to every healthcare worker with time. Every once in a while I get a sweet patient with a horrible prognosis and after they leave, I shed a few tears, I‚Äôm human. But I am always satisfied that in my short time with them, I helped them feel more comfortable and heard and cared for, and that‚Äôs all that matters.\n\n7. IM IN THE UNITED STATES: Other countries require more education. Like nursing though, the US has radiology travelers too! They make really good money and generally only need a year of experience!\n\n8. WORK/LIFE BALANCE AND STRESS: I left teaching because of how unhealthy my work/life balance was. I love my job now because I clock in, do my job, and leave. The only thing I ever have to do outside of work is continuing education credits to maintain my license, which are not hard or very tedious and are only required every other year. The job can be stressful day in and day out if it‚Äôs busy or there are hard patients, but that stress is very short term. I clock out and forget about it, and the next day is a new day!!\n\nI hope this edit was more helpful!!"

I know exactly how I'm supposed to act with guests. Knowing exactly what is wanted/expected makes me extremely comfortable being in front of people and working a room.  I've surprised myself with how good I am at this and how little it drains me.\n\n\nThe nature of the attraction leads guests to do specific things/ask certain questions that are fairly predictable, which makes me comfortable.\n\nBut each person is different, so there is still a ton of variety, surprise and opportunity for improvisation, which keeps me from getting bored. \n\nThere are also a few different attraction activities I can bounce between and it is usually necessary to cycle around cleaning each of them throughout the day as well.  There's pretty much always something to do. \n\n\nThe most challenging thing for me is navigating relationships with my coworkers,  but even that is different from many other jobs I've had because there's a solidarity and team spirit to working in that kind of environment.\n\n\nSo people, take note, your social skills may thrive in the correct environment, with a little practice. \nWorking in an office made me literally want to walk into traffic. My job now makes me feel like a star."

Late-breaking news or weather that changed my rundown regularly kept me on my toes and in ‚Äúfix-it‚Äù mode. \n\nThe biggest drawbacks were the pay (it‚Äôs better than newspaper journalism, but still‚Ä¶ not great) and the risk of burnout is high, because even when it syncs up perfectly with ADHD it‚Äôs still often an intense workday.

Technically being on an emergency cert means I can only work like 16 days a month or something and not more than a certain amount of consecutive days, but there's such a teacher shortage that exemptions are issued constantly. Pay isn't good, but if you're not the primary bread winner, it's a nice little second income.  I love that it's something different every day; that when I get asked to sub for an elementary music teacher or a class where I know the kids are wild, I can say no thank you. The job begins at 8:30 and ends at 3:50 and work stays at work. You might need to think on the fly, triage some problems and get creative but these things are in our wheelhouse! Only taking jobs when I want, and knowing that if I bail, I'm leaving little kids in a bad/annoying situation, is enough motivation to get me to work when I'd rather sleep in."

There‚Äôs no lingering stress day in and day out, every day is brand new!\n\nI got a pay increase from my old job as a teacher, but teachers don‚Äôt make much to begin with. Straight x-ray is more of an entry level job and that can be on the lower side being like $25-$30 an hour if you‚Äôre in a lower cost of living state. If you branch out into higher paying modalities like MRI or Cath Lab, you can make quite a bit more. My coworker who have about five years MRI experience all made six figures in a fairly low cost of living state.\n\nThis new generation of doctors in this digital age love imaging so the field is growing and wages are increasing to keep the field growing.

Doing research on trends and initiatives within the healthcare industry and the company's competitors. It was all of the boring parts with even fewer rewards. I hated the subject matter, I procrastinated more than I ever had in my life on writing the reports. The only fun part was giving presentations, as I'm trained in public speaking. I know presentations suck as a rule but mine do not because I hate everybody else's. It's fun to put on a little show.\n\nThat job was the stepping stone from being a college librarian (research, teaching, public service, sys admin, digital curator but the same year after year after year for very little pay for the education I acquired) and becoming a data engineer.\n\nData Engineering is incredibly satisfying for my brain. Always working on something different. Building a web of familiarity across my domain. Sitting like a fat happy spider waiting for my web to twitch while on call. Orchestrating patterns of activity and watching things flow. Spotting needles in haystacks that break those patterns. Working from home with my dogs and my garden.\n\nI get to plan big initiatives for other people to help carry out. And best of all it's somebody else's job to make sure everybody's work gets across the finish line. And yet another person's to help us figure out what we need to get it done.\n\nInstead of being overwhelmed by the tedium of a task, I get to consume those things in bite sizes, doing them just long enough before my interest wanes. Plus, I'm pretty sure 90% of engineers have ADHD so that's a bonus. I'm incredibly open about it at work and my team lead, project manager, and business analyst all help us keep the big goals in mind."

    "comment": "Not sure when or where you went to school, but that schooling is not common practice in the field. I was an ASRT student rep so I would know. The ASRT and JRECERT have very strict guidelines of what classes you need to do X-ray and that cannot be done on the 2 months you describe. We all do 2 years of solely x-ray with maybe one class of modalities education but that is it.\n\nI live and was educated in a rural state where almost every technologist I‚Äôve been around has multiple modality licenses. In smaller hospitals, many of them bounce between them on any given day. They would be in mammo one day, then CT the next, then X-ray the day after. Although I know some techs who stayed in their one modality, this was the experience of probably over half of the techs I ran into. And every single one of them did their training in those modalities on the job. When I was getting ready to graduate, one job offer I had was to learn CT for two years and then learn MRI so I could do all three.\n\nI am sorry you find radiology so unhappy within the field, I truly am. The vast majority of people I know who work as rad techs are very happy, and if they‚Äôre not, they go to work as a rep or in applications, or they move workplaces to find a place that suits them. There are bad coworkers everywhere you go, that‚Äôs part of life. But for me, this career is something I‚Äôm passionate about so that can get me through working with just about anyone!"

They convinced me I couldn‚Äôt handle full time college so I just worked and did general education courses. Once I got fed up with their opinions about my school work ethic and decided to do this I had to apply twice over a year to get in.\n\nI did work while in school, and ultimately paid for the entire thing but I was primarily busting my ass at a tip-based food service job every weekend. I fought hard for tiny scholarships to help pay for books (pressure your scholarship office!) and in the last semester I quit my food job and lived frugally on my first (smallish) college loan so I could focus on studying for boards. My grandparents not charging me rent was a massive factor in a lot of my decisions. This all sounds great but it took me 5 years total due to my slow start. Plus I felt like a failure since all my buddies went off to party at universities which I never got to do. \n\nI know classmates that worked full time while doing it but I‚Äôm not quite sure how they managed it. One of my classmates was like 50 with a teen and he worked nights while doing class and clinical during the day and graduated and deserves extreme props for it. You don‚Äôt get a choice of when your classes are for a program like this. You are always with your classmates in the program, it‚Äôs never solo. Half the days you‚Äôre in class, half the days you‚Äôre training in the hospital. The ratio changes as you progress.\n\nSure it‚Äôs not nursing but I‚Äôm not gonna lie the courses are very challenging. But I was unmedicated for unfortunate reasons so I‚Äôm sure a medicated person can do it. After your first year, a lot of programs make you work an unpaid full time summer in the hospital before your next year starts. That‚Äôs the real burnout. After a few years of regular X-ray work I went on to learn CT since nobody can command you to come running with a machine, they have to come to your machine.\n\nI‚Äôm being this specific because people like to act self-made and don‚Äôt acknowledge the help they receive along the way. I‚Äôm proud I managed to pay for my schooling but without my grandparents providing me a free place to live and food I‚Äôm not so sure I would have made it. But my class was filled with just as many adults making career changes as new students so it‚Äôs definitely possible!

Google says the average salary in AUD for med rad techs is $80-90k, paramedics vary a lot from $60-100k+, and anaesthetists get about $300-400k. Not health related but we also pay our teachers much better üòÖ straight out of university is $70k and you go up a pay bracket every 200 working days until it caps at about $110 unless you go into leadership."

Even if I have time at the end of a day, I‚Äôm often too tired and emotionally drained. Although there are periods when it‚Äôs not as bad, it‚Äôs hard to predict when these times will be as you‚Äôre at your client‚Äôs whim and they often hit you with last minute curveballs and requests. We don‚Äôt have project managers where I work (maybe that‚Äôs the key difference!) so there‚Äôs a lot of managing our own deadlines and really fast paced work; having ADHD I tend to leave things to the last minute and have this perpetual feeling that I‚Äôm letting people down. I also find dealing with corporate clients and being at their whims super stressful. Maybe it‚Äôs a personal thing, but I also get mega impostor syndrome and suffer from perfectionism, I‚Äôm constantly second guessing myself and it feels like I‚Äôm losing a game that I don‚Äôt even want to be playing, because ultimately I don‚Äôt care about what I‚Äôm doing.

    "comment": "Omg I‚Äôm in public health too! Currently doing my MPH. I don‚Äôt see my field being mentioned here a lot so this got me excited lol. \n\nI‚Äôm working for a huge longitudinal research project and I HATE IT. I‚Äôve made several posts about but it‚Äôs a project with over 20k participants and we‚Äôre responsible for the recruiting, booking ppl and managing calls AS WELL AS doing the data collection when participants arrive. We literally have to split our days so our evenings are doing appointments with the ppl and mornings are answering calls, emails, booking and reviewing the data. I got into a really bad place because it felt like all my work was going nowhere and found no meaning in what I did. I also really struggled with finishing everything I had to do before my appointments bc you really never know what type of email or phone call you get plus I had to prepare for the appointments In the evening. So by the time it‚Äôs 3:30 I‚Äôm rushing to go to the clinic for appointments with several tasks unfinished and the cycle continues. I had to speak with my supervisor and tell her I couldn‚Äôt handle it so I have one less day with appointment. Oh also I‚Äôm in full time school ü§£ \n\nEvery part of this job is terrible for me mostly bc I need to see results of my work but I didn‚Äôt have that. I could spend my whole day working so hard but nothing to show for it.. I had to take a couple months off because of the overwhelm and I‚Äôm currently looking at other jobs. I‚Äôve done research jobs before and I genuinely enjoyed it because I was responsible only for the data collection and got to make connections with the people I was with. Make a report and be done with that. But this research job I have is something else.. I do like having different tasks but the level of task switching involved at this job is more than my brain could handle. For me there‚Äôs a fine line between the right amount of variety to being overwhelmed. Plus all those never ending projects and deadlines and pressure is what is really affecting me. \n\nI cannot stress enough how important it is for anyone but especially those with adhd to find a job that you at least enjoy 80% of the time. After my shift I would be in such bad moods and spend my time doing absolutely nothing just to cope. Theres too much of an impact on your life that isn‚Äôt worth it. My job didn‚Äôt only affect 40 hours of my week. It affected my whole life.\n\n\n\nEDIT: \nI just wanted to mention while I hate this research job, I love the field of public health. Im doing my masters and my undergrad was also in this field so it‚Äôs something I rly enjoy. I was a health educator/promoter for the same company and I LOVED IT SO MUCH. My adhd brain loved it!! This was the perfect mix of tasks as I got to do what I was passionate about. It was a bit of designing posters for health care professionals, a bit of social media planning, a bit of community engagement as well as project management. And it paid more. But sadly it was a short contract. For me this type of work doesn‚Äôt feel at all like a job bc it‚Äôs stuff I did years ago when volunteering and it felt meaningful. With research that component was a huge missing piece. I‚Äôm hoping to find more roles that allow me to do this.\n\nSo if you‚Äôre in public health maybe look into this as well if you like having that meaningful part of your job. I know others prefer not so data and research works well too so it depends on what works for you."

I curate a collection of information that is easily navigable for our clients to locate what they need to design their own reports. I'm not a data analyst, nor a data scientist. It's my job to make sure THOSE folks have clean data to work with.\n\nI have talked about my career transition pretty extensively in my post history if you want a deep dive, but to sum it all up, first I learned the language R which gave me a solid foundation in the structure of data. Then I got my feet wet with data visualization tools at the healthcare job. Tableau and Power BI. I casually studied the basics of graphic design which translates nicely to data design. It's all about storytelling.\n\nEventually, I got a lead on the company I work for now and brushed up on SQL. R is like more readable SQL so I already knew the concepts. I just needed to know the syntax better. I also played with python a bit which I'm starting to use even more now.\n\nI am entirely self taught on this path. I used sites like DataCamp and HackerRank. The stuff I didn't have a handle on, I learned along the way. The soft skills I brought from 10 years professional experience has helped me pole vault up the ladder from where I started. I'm coming up on 2 years as an engineer and I've received 2 promotions and INCREDIBLY substantial raises, outpacing those on the team with degrees in these subjects.\n\nProgramming isn't really about knowing how to do absolutely everything. It's about having the kind of brain that can combine what you know is possible with solid problem solving and googling skills to arrive at an answer.\n\nFor what it's worth, I'm also the girl on the team. I think because we have such a solid support team (which I helped curate), I'm not treated as the admin assistant but I'm also very tight with those folks and it has gone a long way in helping the team develop and fire on all cylinders. I can talk to them without talking over them, as many engineers are prone to do. I also have helped these nerds talk about their feelings in nonconfrontational ways.

I was fascinated with public health but would struggle with long term projects and research. I did an epi program because it seemed the most exciting, but the downfall of that was needing to start at lower paying entry level public health professions. A lot of which are not very exciting and can take awhile to be promoted at. I also had a lot of student loans to pay off so I knew it would be tough to accept an an entry level PH position. I wish I enjoyed biostatistics a bit more since that can definitely be a higher starting salary. \n\nAnyways, I ended up getting into Medical writing/ clinical trial transparency and I love it! I get to work with a variety of different protocols, clinical study reports, and plain language summaries at a time which keeps things interesting. Different activities/assignments can take anywhere from an hour to a few months, but from an ADHDers perspective the timelines are not that hard to manage. At the end of the day it is rewarding to know I am helping make scientific research & clinical trials more comprehensible for people without science backgrounds. I use my MPH knowledge to understand the material ( for example complex study designs, statistical significance of results, different populations being studied) and then condense it down to an 6th grade reading level.

So when I'm at my desk, I'm constantly anxious because there are a million things on my mind. I have so many tools to help me remember things that my coworkers think I'm crazy. I use a whiteboard, five notebooks, sticky notes, several apps, and calendars. And yet, even with all of that, I still end up forgetting things. For example, today I had a physio appointment, and I completely forgot about it and arrived late because I had so many other things on my mind.\n\nI don't want to rant all day, but I could if I wanted to. So I completely understand where you're coming from and I GET YOU. \n\nI've invested a lot of time and money trying to keep up, but I'm slowly realizing that this isn't the right fit for me. It took a lot to come to this realization because at first, what got to me was how effortlessly others could do it, while I struggled miserably. Especially the new hire who came on just a week before me. I always felt like I was behind and slowing down the team, even though I knew for a fact that I was putting in the most effort. I started to see myself as a failure, and my mind was filled with negative thoughts about myself. It took two months of restoring, resting, and realigning with my passions and purpose to get me back on track. I know this very well as I‚Äôve been there for 6 months now with 2 of those months being off due to overwhelm and an accident. I was doing so well before this job, and I was doing well during my time off, so it was crystal clear that the job was the issue.\n\nWhat also made me realize it wasn't for me was when it began to impact my health in practical ways. I couldn't schedule my therapy sessions due to a lack of time and overwhelm. I couldn't plan my personal training sessions either because I had to work evenings, and my gym doesn't offer morning sessions. I couldn‚Äôt take my simple mental health drive and/or walks (I do these regularly to calm my mind and process heavy thoughts). I haven‚Äôt done that since my time off back in February when I used to do it every single day. These may seem like small things, but I had a really good thing going on before this job, and my mental health was at an excellent stage. I felt in control on bad days, whereas now, I feel like managing my mental health is like walking on eggshells. One wrong move, and I break down, so I've been in survival mode. This has made me hostile, and I've never seen this side of myself since I started working intentionally on my mental health.\n\nI couldn't even meal prep because I wasn't in the mood, and all I craved was junk food to make me feel better. I've done a lot of work on myself, and a big indicator that things are going badly is when I start going to drive-thrus more frequently. Well, three weeks into the job, and I was already going multiple times a week. For context, I rarely crave junk food on a regular day. So This isn't normal for me at all, where going out to dinner with friends a couple of times a month was the most I would do.\n\nSo while these things may seem small, they really aren't. Exercising, meal prepping, meditating/prayer and therapy are the foundation of my well-being. And if my job is preventing me from doing the bare minimum to keep myself healthy, then it's an obstacle that simply isn't worth it!\n\nThanks if you‚Äôre still reading. I‚Äôm sorry to hear your negative experiences at your job. I would 1000% suggest you leave as well. This life is too short and I would never spend it on an environment/place/job that‚Äôs making you miserable. It‚Äôs not worth it when there are so  many more opportunities that exist! I really wish you all the best with your job search or whatever you choose to do! I trust that you‚Äôll figure it out."

Well, the reason I asked is that I've always dreamed of becoming a journalist. \n  \nJournalism was just an elective that we had back in HS. I enjoyed it a lot and loved every bit of it, but when I finally graduated, I was one of those who's totally confused as to what degree is right for me.\n  \nAlso, my mom always wanted engineering for me. So I got into that, which always made me wonder, what if I became a journalist instead? That's my reason for asking and so now I learned that the competition is tough, which sometimes I love in a field but also hate kinda! \n\nThanks for the input! Now it got me thinking, maybe there's some option for you to be like that YouTuber Johnny Harris. He's a journalist too, but maybe not the same pressure as what journalists usually get I suppose? Have a look and see if it's something of your interest. Again thanks!"

I started on ritalin about 7 months ago and was off it for a few months because of health issues, but it's helped me so much in the time I started it and now that I'm back on it. Points 3 and 6 really resonate with me, my mind has always been very negative/sensitive/on edge. When I found I was suddenly able to go about life without my mind telling me so and so is mad at me, what did I do, they're being mean to me, I'm awful, I'm lazy, I feel left out even though I was the one who decided not to go... now I'm less paranoid about how people feel about me, I can take criticism, I can keep up with the people I love and not take it personally when they take a while to get back to me. I'm more open and vulnerable with the people I love. Although you can tell I still can't edit my words lol, I can only write essays or 1 sentence.\n\nAnd points 5 and 7- I am still a mess but i have the drive to go through everything and un-jumble it once or twice a week instead of having it pile up for so long I don't know where to start. And for 7- I'm finally motivated to do the basic things for myself I've always wanted to but just somehow couldn't. Stretching every day, trying to get some steps in even when I don't feel like it, keeping on top of my hygiene in terms of showering, skincare, dental care. I went years with awful dental hygiene and my brain would always say just get up and do it! Now! But my body wouldn't move. Now it does. My body responds to my brain and will just get up and do it. If not that second, I still manage to get it done before the days end. \n\nThankyou for this post.

Especially noticeable has been breaking large projects with a future completion date into smaller manageable chunks. This was literally impossible to do on my own in the past. I would either get entirely overwhelmed and not start or start and rush to complete the whole thing all at once while making lots of mistakes along the way and leaving an incomplete disaster."

    "comment": "I thought I would share what some of experience has been with working with medical professionals in my country and how my different health teams have talked about it. I have autoimmune arthritis and was diagnosed with fibromyalgia about 2 years after the arthritis because I was still feeling pain and fatigue even though my swelling and hot joints etc seemed to be under control and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories didn‚Äôt seem to help. Rheumatologist didn‚Äôt give a lot of info after diagnosing me but she never does haha (I personally dislike her bedside manner but w/e her nurses are nice and the meds she gives me work). She said it‚Äôs common for people with autoimmune disease to also develop fibro. Prescribed me low dose amitriptyline, took my first dose that night and felt a huge difference when I woke up the next morning and realised I had actually had really poor sleep quality until then and didn‚Äôt realise! I also felt improvement in my exec functioning and was like üëÄ because I hadn‚Äôt pursued ADHD diagnosis then but knowing amitriptyline did norepinephrine and that that norepinephrine was a part of ADHD. Anyway that‚Äôs just a side note haha. \n\nMy GP doc took time to give me more info about fibromyalgia but had a general gist from her and the rheum that some think that fibro can happen when the nervous system goes through too much and kinda freaks out and overreacts (causing pain) kind of thing.\n\nThen I went on a fibromyalgia pain management course with the pain clinic occupational therapist. They said that they believed that fibro was probably inflammation in the tiny muscle fibres either caused by a lack of having the right things it needs like oxygen or whatever idk. I stopped going after the first 2 of the 4 sessions as I wasn‚Äôt learning anything new and they kept talking about breathing exercises and they explained Spoon theory wrong lol. \n\nAnyway, it seems kinda like each person had their own theory on fibro. What is interesting to me though is that we don‚Äôt actually have Lyme carrying ticks etc in my country. My mum got unwell after visiting Mongolia and suspects she got Lyme disease there, but I have never left our country and so haven‚Äôt been to a place where I could have caught it. But I still have fibromyalgia, whatever it is that medics and scientists end up figuring it out to be. And that so far amitriptyline works. Im just glad that the industry seems to be taking fibromyalgia more seriously now days and I hope that less of them don‚Äôt still hold the belief that fibro is just a made up thing their patients read about on the internet üò©"

After that I felt normal, less mistakes at work though. I had trouble sleeping at night. Ended up sleeping at 2am then taking multiple 1hr naps until 12nn. I also felt irritated in the morning. Honestly, don't know how to feel about the meds yet."

Meds are like 20-30% of the solution for ADHD, exercise is another 10-20%, and knowledge + effort make up the remaining 50-60%.\n\nBeyond, if you've got a shit mindset or bad self beliefs they can prevent anything from fixing your problems.  If you've got a good mindset/internal monologue, then everything in your life will be more effective.  So if you would describe yourself as a pessimist, you need to study learned optimism/growth mindset/positive self talk/reframing negative thoughts, which are all part of CBT."

    "comment": "**Obligatory PSA. Prepare yourself.**\n\nI'm infinitely and unquestionably on the side of blaming the god awful gun control we have, and I don't blame school shootings on ADHD meds like the criminally spineless NRA. With that said, the comments I'm reading are worrying. Dissociative drugs of any kind can bring someone to the point of shooting up a school, although extremely unlikely. There is overwhelming research showing the dissociative effects that many psych meds produce, including those prescribed for ADHD, which is not to say that there aren't other factors. Dissociative effects are hard for me to explain but if you don't know, it could be described as having your personality or psyche torn into 2, while simultaneously functioning as one. You somewhat disconnect from the world and yourself, which is DEFINITELY an underlying cause to suicidal/homicidal tendencies. It's weird and varying but that's why it's so mind altering in unpredictable ways. These symptoms could even lead to difficulty with sexual activity, because sex is very emotional and personal, and dissociation is separating your conscious from your emotions. No matter how you reacted to medication, dissociation is linked to ADHD medication, and its ignorant and dangerous to apply your reaction to every single person who takes this junk. You can't possibly expect a psychological drug to never ever throw somebody's mind for a spin, it's going to happen, and you shouldn't say it's not the drug because I didn't do that.\n\nIf we are to expect our communities to see ADHD for what it is and not just dismiss it, or in this case, use it as a target to offload blame, we cannot keep contradicting the scientific evidence that these are not perfect pills. I hate getting on this subreddit and seeing the mentality that its ok to take adderall for your entire life and this assumption that there's nothing bad about it. It's a brutal fucking stimulant, and it radically destabilizes your psyche. Our condition is severely mishandled by several parties involved in the process. Big pharma is keeping new meds out of the market because addictive stimulants like adderall are beneficial to their wallets, and doctors don't know nearly enough about the condition or all the ways to actually treat it. We can't do much about that right now, but that isn't a reason to scramble the chemistry of our bodies without question or caution. We are intelligent minds in primitive bodies, and everything you put into your existential vehicle is going to manifest itself one way or another, whether its food or pills. \n\n**Please please please please** be conscious of your mental health and do not lean on your meds. Use them as a catalyst to build better habits over time, so you can function without them. We got dealt a less than ideal hand, we will have to inevitably work harder. Who cares, take pride in it. There is no level playing field, everyone has a disadvantage really. It's all about who masters their weakness the best.\n\nPressure yourself to see how much you can avoid getting your dosage increased or how much caffeine you can take out of your day. Both of these things want to be together but your heart doesn't want either of them, if you can help it. Nicotine also isn't a good mix because of a synergetic chain reaction with dopamine causing a severely increased level of addiction, but instead of explaining that fascinating interaction, just stay away from nicotine because your life depends on it. Meditation is hard for us to get into but with enough practice, its euphorically helpful, way more effective than any prescription drug. If we act on impulses, what better way to achieve focus by specifically practicing our ability to acknowledge impulses and then let them drift away. Try having fun researching a new diet. I can only force myself to do one simple task in the morning, which is usually reddit and not breakfast, and I found out carbs metabolize into sugar. So now, almost every morning, I'll get up and panfry bacon and pre-diced zucchini, break up a hard-boiled egg I did at the beginning of the week, and voila, 5 minute breakfast bowl you can make with one hand, doesn't even really need seasoning. It's not exactly luxurious but it has the nutrients your body wants first thing in the morning, you don't feel bloated afterwards, it's super easy to make, and the energy you get from it sustains all day since protein and fat burn far more efficiently. Amazing way to start the day, try it for a week. Also great for hangovers. You've heard it soooo many times and I'm a hypocrite for saying this but get into exercising. Your whole body starts \"hyperfunctioning\", if that makes sense, just by going on a 10 minute jog. Blood is circulating to all your organs, your lungs are absorbing oxygen, lactic acid is getting flushed, any bad calories are burnt, sweat is opening pores and pushing out bad skin oils, just all the systems are going and it really helps you feel more clear and present. Shit. Now I have to jog tomorrow, too motivated thinking about it. FIX YOUR SLEEP SCHEDULE. Its 4:30am and I hate myself. It's really hard. I can't give any advice on this one, it's plagued me for so long.\n\nRemember, it's ok to screw up, and it's not because of your meds, and it's not because of you. I find myself obsessing over mistakes so much these days that I forget that mistakes are the best way to learn, they are inevitable, life will always have a curve ball to throw. We have some funky brains but we still need to respect our mind and body. I don't contemplate or even remotely consider acting on it, but I do daydream about suicide and self harm on a daily basis due to my medication, and its fucking terrifying to see so many people in a similar cognitive position as me completely brushing off the notion that the medication we take for ADHD could possibly lead to mass homicide is even more terrifying. Please use it as a temporary tool and respect its dangers, so we don't have this disconnect with our peers. I strive for compassion and positive action, so I really care for the communities I engage with and that especially means all of you.\n\nWork hard, stay humble, think mindfully, and be yourself."

A lot of it is a generational thing; it's very acceptable to joke about things that push boundaries really far so long as most everyone knows you're kidding.

Literally, they cannot find any long-term moderate or serious effects. One study showed an increase risk of heart disease in people who took methylphenidate, but the risk was higher for people on low doses than those on high doses, and it turns out people with pre-existing heart conditions are more likely to be prescribed methylphenidate than amphetamine, and more likely to be on low doses. So, people with pre-existing heart conditions are at higher risk of heart disease, and also some of them take methylphenidate. \n\nIn children, one study found that kids taking stimulants were 1 inch shorter and 6 pounds lighter than kids who don‚Äôt take stimulants, but then they found that was only true for the first two years on medication, after which the kids caught up in height and weight even if they continued to take the medication.\n\n[If you don‚Äôt already have a heart condition, all stimulants are demonstrably fine long-term.](https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2015/04/28/10/06/the-safety-of-stimulant-medication-use-in-cardiovascular-and-arrhythmia-patients) The only long term effects are mildly elevated heart rate and blood pressure, which are not serious and can be mitigated. If you do have a heart condition, they‚Äôre still often fine depending on which heart condition and which medication you‚Äôre on.\n\nWith respect to liver damage, I can‚Äôt find any literature on liver damage from ADHD medication so that other commenter is talking out of their ass. \n\nStimulants also don‚Äôt stick around in the body. If you take them in the morning, they are completely gone from your system by the next morning. There‚Äôs no harm in taking medication breaks if that works for you. But there‚Äôs also no harm in taking the extremely low doses of safe medication you have been prescribed. The level of anxiety you express in this post is likely to do just as much harm to your body in exactly the same way, because anxiety also increases your heart rate and blood pressure."

    "comment": "As far as toxicity goes, as far as I know, methylphenidate is filtered by the kidneys rather than the liver, so there is no risk of liver toxicity. As for the kidneys, methylphenidate and other stimulant style medications may cause your body to burn fat for the sugar stores, which must later be processed by the kidneys. The sugar influx is usually more damaging than the meds. You‚Äôll know if you are taking too much, though, because you‚Äôll start having to pee more and May get sleepy due to the sugar crash. \n\nIf you are taking the right amount, kidney damage is typically not an issue. The only reason you would need to worry is if you have diabetes or pre-existing kidney damage, in which case you‚Äôll want to make sure that you know what dosage you can take safely and not go over that. Ideally, take an extended release variant so your body doesn‚Äôt release as much sugar. \n\nAs far as tolerance:\nWith people who have adhd‚Ä¶you can start to build a tolerance, but ultimately there is a point at which that stops and your body is at equilibrium with the medication. For some people this is a low dose, for others it is much higher. \n\nThere are also different types of adhd, and different medicines work better for each. Unfortunately, there is no known way to find out which type you have, except for trying different meds to see how each med affects you. \n\nOther negative symptoms you may find:\nStimulant meds typically raise heart rate and blood pressure. If you have chronic pain or arthritis, the increased blood pressure may result in increased inflammation. If that affects you, you may want to try a different medication. \n\nPositive symptoms:\nThe increased heart rate means more blood to the brain, so staying awake while reading scientific papers becomes far easier."

    "comment": "One of the effects of taking stimulants long term, for someone with ADHD, is that your brain starts to look more like that of a person without ADHD.\n\nHere's what it was useful for me to realize. You are trying to operate WITHOUT the optimal amount of neurotransmitter in your brain. Stimulants push you up to a \"normal\" level of that, not \"above\", which is what neurotypical people are doing when they get high.\n\nAny \"dependency\" is just your brain wanting to work correctly. From a neurobiological point of view, withdrawing a chemical that makes your brain function normally is going to feel bad. You are already \"dependent\" on it, in the sense that without it you return to or operate at a baseline that is not as functional.\n\nTolerance would certainly be a challenge, so I can see your concern there, as would other health effects."

    "comment": "All the wishful thinking people saying that stimulants have no long-term effects are wrong.\n\nThe body, including the brain, works based off of homeostasis.  This means that when you increase the level of dopamine in the brain, the brain will respond by increasing the number of dopamine transporters (which remove dopamine).\n\nThere are several studies showing effects like this, e.g.\n\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0063023\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3770255/\n\nThis means that the brain continuously makes you more and more resistant to dopamine the longer you are on stimulants.  So when you go off stimulants, you're brain state will be worse than when you started.\n\nIf you stay on stimulants forever, then maybe that's not a problem.  But for many people, methylphenidate tolerance builds and sometimes eventually stops working well (google \"methylphenidate stopped working site:www.reddit.com\" to see how common this is).  Or you may start getting side effects like heart or gastric issues that cause you to cease medication.  At that point, you my suffer significant anhedonia, lethargy, and difficulty focusing due to the increased levels of dopamine transporters.\n\nThis is all basic homeostasis.  You can't expect to take stimulants every day without having an effect on your brain."

I do annual blood work and urine sample at my doctor's recommendation (and have been for a little over a decade iirc).\n\nAlso the dose you're prescribed sounds pretty low.

    "comment": "A Layman's opinion so **\\[Trigger Warning\\]**. I'm not a medical professional so take what I say with a grain of salt. Also anyone who disagrees feel free to chime in, I am pretty open minded and would like to hear other opinions as long as they aren't insults. \n\nHaving said that, there are a couple things I take into account with anyone who says that \"there are **no** **risks**\" with any medication. It's common sense to me that there will be always be some kind of physical affect on a molecular and chemical level every time you introduce a foreign entity to your body and it is broken down by your body. Anyone saying that there are no risks, is simply incorrect. *If you believe that bad food can affect your health over the course of weeks/months/years, why would you think that distilled drugs will not? The same drugs that you can overdose and die on, won't affect your biology in the long run?*\n\nAnother thing I think worth mentioning is scientific studies are often produced by financial interest groups. Which means that a study will not be done if it doesn't benefit the agenda of the organization funding it. This is why there is very little known about specific illnesses (brain zaps is an example) because no company is making money doing studies on that. *Don't mistake the lack of evidence for a conclusion that things are absolutely safe.* \n\nThe truth is there is a lot of undiscovered science that is left to the ether because no one wants to know the answers to them because it is not helping capitalism. A study that proves that specific drugs cause long term issues will affect long term company profits and so what is the incentive to do these studies. Most of these adverse affects are only reported because it was not the original intention of the study (which was probably more about the positive effects of the drug) and have to be reported legally.\n\nA prime example of an instance where medicine was promoted but actually harmful is the history of the opioid epidemic. Doctors promoted pain killers and opioids for years, pushed by financial incentives of big pharma. This caused the deaths of tens of thousands of individuals (Watch the HBO Documentary: *The Crime of the Century*)**.** It was normal and beneficial to promote opioids until people started dropping like flies. \n\nI bring up the opioid epidemic **not** to make a direct comparison to stimulants for ADHD, they aren't the same thing. But I bring it up to illustrate that as a consumer you have to be conscious of the forces that are present within the pharmaceutical industry. Trust your gut, and weigh your own risk vs benefits, do not let anyone else do it for you because their interest is not with you.   \n\n\nI take stimulants myself for my ADHD and I immediately notice side-effects. One for me is elevated heart rate, sometimes sweating, and chest pain. I know it is different for everyone depending on their biology, but again, just because you don't see the day to day effects does not mean that it isn't happening. Every time your heart rate is elevated for example, your heart is beating more cycles than it would originally without the medication. There is wear-and-tear as with anything, and imagine a balloon being inflated and deflated, eventually it will wear out over time as the elasticity fades. That is common sense. Your cells have only a set number of reproductions before telomeres shorten enough to have severe health issues. If cell death and rebirth is accelerated via external factors (such as excessive heart beating) it will certainly shorten life-span. **The ultimate question then is, how much is your life shortened?**   \n\n\nI don't know the answer to that, my guess is it is caused by a number of factors including how often you take the drugs, other stressors to your body, your inherent DNA and other unique personalized health risks.   \n\n\nAs to how these stimulant health-risk studies are done, I would love to know more because I do not know how someone could ascertain an accurate gauge of how much potential years you'd shave off your life when the controls aren't even the same. Since every person's biology is different it is almost unpredictable and hard to know how much life you are actually shaving off since it will vary depending on unique biology. If there were twin studies, now that would make more sense and I'd love to see that if that was available.   \n\n\nIn conclusion, dispense with the idea that there are zero negative effects to any medication. There is always side-effects, and long term effects even if you are currently asymptomatic. It's the same idea with individuals who develop cancer. You're asymptomatic for 20 years, until one day you have cancer. The thing is there were probably thousands of decisions and controllable factors that could have created more risk of cancer/accelerated it in those 20 years, including factors such as sleep, diet, stressors, and environment. The unfortunate thing is that it is impossible to measure those factors accurately. The same thing can be said about any medication. There is no way to prove for example if your hypothetical early death 20 years from now is directly linked to taking your stimulant medication. There are also forces out there that will skew the data and define it differently as to avoid lawsuits or profit loss.   \n\n\nSo the best thing to do is, trust your gut. Assess your own risks/benefits. See how much you can get away with not taking medication. I understand with people with ADHD you are often completely dysfunctional without it, trust me I experience that myself. However, there are probably more balanced and efficient ways to handle your unique situation. Perhaps spacing out the medication, micro-dosing, or looking for other stimulant alternatives. I would just explore every other option first before assuming that taking the medication will not affect you in the long run. Hope this was a helpful insight to anyone reading this."

I did that for a couple of years. When I got ‚Äúbaby fever‚Äù, I decided to quit everything, and I quit cold turkey. What a nightmare. I suffered from headache, irritability, sleep problems, tremors, hot flashes, and heart palpitations for eight full weeks.  I had an easier time getting off OxyContin (and that was no picnic, I‚Äôll tell you).  \n\nCaffeine is a weird drug. Pharmaceutical stimulants are much cleaner and safer."

    "comment": ">\tEven when I take it the following days, I feel that they do work less.\n\nThat‚Äôs in your head. It would take much longer than that to actually develop a tolerance. \n\nNow, it‚Äôs worth noting that when you first start taking ADD meds they can have a very mild mood elevating effect, much like coffee. You might notice it ‚Äúkick in.‚Äù \n\nAfter a while, much like coffee, you will stop noticing that as much and it will just feel normal. You might not notice the difference in the same way you did the first couple days but the effectiveness has not changed. \n\nAnecdotally, I have also noticed that short acting meds like methylphenidate have a much more noticeable rise and fall as you metabolize them. Long release meds, like concerta and vyvanse, tend to rise a bit more gradually but then will plateau for hours and then have a more gentle fade as they start to wear off. It‚Äôs much less jarring, and more consistent, so that tends to be the preferred option for people who need the effects to last all day (or at least through the work day). \n\nAnyway, you might be noticing a bit of that. If so, don‚Äôt worry about it. You‚Äôre still getting the benefit of the meds. \n\nOr, and this strikes me as more likely, you‚Äôre just anxious about taking the meds and your imagination is running wild a bit. You‚Äôre worried about developing a tolerance so you are hyper vigilant looking for signs. \n\nKeep in mind that a lot of people when they start these meds don‚Äôt notice a difference *at all* until someone else notices and points it out to them. That‚Äôs extremely common. \n\nThey aren‚Äôt *intended* to make you ‚Äúfeel‚Äù different. They just help you function better. So just because you aren‚Äôt noticing them work doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt. \n\nYou‚Äôll be fine. If you have shit to do and feel like your meds will help, go ahead and take them. That‚Äôs what they‚Äôre for. As long as you don‚Äôt exceed the prescribed dosage/intervals you‚Äôre totally fine. There‚Äôs also nothing wrong with skipping a day if you‚Äôve got nothing going on. A lot of people, for example, skip their meds on the weekend. A lot of people don‚Äôt, because that‚Äôs when they do their house chores or work on hobbies. That‚Äôs also perfectly fine. Don‚Äôt overthink it.\n\nAnd if you find they work a bit less over time that‚Äôs also not a big deal. Talk to your doctor about it, and he can adjust your dosage. That‚Äôs extremely common, and not a sign that anything is wrong. They‚Äôre never as effective as when you first start taking them, but they continue to be a huge benefit. Most people have to up their dosage at some point, but then find a dose that works best for them and tend to be pretty stable after that. \n\nAgain, don‚Äôt worry about it if that happens. You‚Äôre on a very low dose right now so unless you have very  mild symptoms or you are a very small person I would be surprised if that continues to be enough forever. \n\nTL;DR\nThat‚Äôs too soon to be developing a tolderance, and if you do develop a bit of a tolerance that‚Äôs normal and not a problem."

I am 24 now and can honestly say that I have never had big issues with tolerance. When I was a kid we did have to titrate up occasionally, but currently I‚Äôve been on the same dose of my same stimulant for over three years, and there are no signs of needing a change. \n\nAs for ‚Äúdependency,‚Äù I don‚Äôt think that word applies in this context, at least in the context where there‚Äôs a negative stigma attached to it. Stimulants help our brains make enough of the neurotransmitters we‚Äôre missing so we can be functional. To put this in perspective, who would ever accuse a diabetic of being ‚Äúdependent‚Äù on their insulin? Their bodies don‚Äôt produce enough of it/are resistant to it, so they add what they need to be functional. \n\nThere‚Äôs a stigma around ADHD medication (and psychotropic drugs in general) that is very harmful and pretty much entirely untrue when it‚Äôs used in the correct context. It is extremely safe, people taking it are not ‚Äúaddicts,‚Äù and these misconceptions really hurt people like me who have severe ADHD and rely on stimulants. Stimulants are my insulin- if I don‚Äôt take them, I‚Äôm not a functional human being. I‚Äôd encourage you to examine why you hold these ideas, where they came from, and if they actually hold merit."

So I might not ‚Äòfeel‚Äô the difference anymore but it certainly still works. \n\nI kinda are ‚Äòdepended‚Äô on it, but more because I‚Äôm so happy that I function as a semi normal human being.

Usually you settle after two weeks or so of taking it every day and then hit a constant level,  5mg is ridiculously low though so expect to probably land at 10-15. You're not going to shoot up further after the first few weeks.  \n\nIt's also not addicting if you have ADHD. Look through the sub how many of us actually keep forgetting to take their meds. I've been on vyvanse and play my daily dose by ear because I fluctuate a lot and can go from 0 to max dose allowed and everything in between with no or few issues."

I personally have not noticed any reduction in efficacy after a year on generic Adderall and have taken the max dose from the get-go. \n\nRe: dependency, when taken as prescribed methylphenidate is low risk for dependency. This is partly because it‚Äôs such a short-acting medication, and partly because people who take medication for their ADHD substantially lower their addiction risk across the board (because untreated ADHD is itself an enormous addiction risk).\n\nPrescription doses of methylphenidate and amphetamine salts are very similar to caffeine in terms of risks and effects. Yes, they do stuff to your brain. Also, it‚Äôs all very short term stuff! People get addicted to caffeine, but if they quit for just two weeks their brains return to their normal, uncaffeinated state. The perception that prescription stimulants are more ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù than coffee comes from drug abuse and crystal meth, which is just not comparable to therapeutic doses of appropriate medication. It‚Äôs comparing apples to mega sour apple bombs."

    "comment": ">\tbut rather the quality of life affecting changes, such as long-term tolerance/dependency.\n\nWell, tolerance usually isn‚Äôt a big deal. A certain amount of tolerance is normal. At some point you may need to bump your dose, which is fine as long as you aren‚Äôt already at the limit and continue to find any side effects tolerable. \n\nAlternatively, you can take a break from your meds for a while, or at intervals, to reduce your tolerance and maintain efficacy. This is usually referred to as a ‚Äúmed vacation.‚Äù \n\nBut expect them to help somewhat less over the years. Not just because of tolerance but because we get used to having them. That‚Äôs normal. You‚Äôre still going to struggle sometimes. The trick, in my opinion, is to use the good days to establish habits, organization methods, and coping mechanisms that will reduce the burden on the bad days. The meds don‚Äôt do the work for you, they just make it possible to get the benefits from the work you were already putting in. \n\nAs for ‚Äúdependency.‚Äù Well, if you mean that in the medical sense, many people do suffer minor withdrawal symptoms when they miss their medication, especially if they take a heavy dose. Others do not. But we‚Äôre talking about caffeine level withdrawal, not heroin. You aren‚Äôt about to go knock over a liquor store so that you can get your fix. You‚Äôll probably just be a bit ‚Äúfuzz brained‚Äù as I like to describe it. Again, I would compare it to quitting caffeine cold Turkey. Unpleasant but not debilitating. And you might get the munchies. Or not. My sister takes the same meds and doesn‚Äôt get any withdrawal if she skips a day. \n\nAfter that withdrawal wears off, which can take anywhere from no time at all to a week or two, your brain chemistry completely reverts to normal. Doesn‚Äôt matter whether you‚Äôve been taking it for six months or 60 years. There are no permanent changes in brain chemistry like there can be with, for example, cocaine, methamphetamine, or alcohol. Even children develop just fine (although that‚Äôs somewhat difficult to prove clinically. Either way the evidence is overwhelmingly that that any hypothetical effects of the meds are probably far less destructive than the results of growing up without them tend to be). \n\nSo it‚Äôs not going to make you a junkie or burn your brain out. \n\nNow, if you mean ‚Äúdependency‚Äù in the sense that you feel like you shouldn‚Äôt need a crutch‚Ä¶ Well, there‚Äôs no shame in needing a crutch if you have a bad leg. Adult ADD is a persistent condition. It‚Äôs not something you can fix, or will get better on its own. There‚Äôs something physiologically different in your brain, and having a medical intervention helps improve your functioning and quality of life. That‚Äôs no different from someone who needs to walk with a cane, or a diabetic who takes insulin. No one loves having to take medication but it‚Äôs a lot better than the alternative. \n\nSo yeah, you might need to take it the rest of your life. That‚Äôs fine. Most of us do. And if one day you don‚Äôt\n\nIf you‚Äôve been walking with a limp your whole life and someone offers you a cane, and the cane dramatically improves your life, then don‚Äôt worry about whether you‚Äôre ‚Äúdependent‚Äù on the cane. Could you go back to limping? Sure, but why would you when you walk so much better with the cane? \n\nThere‚Äôs a stigma attached to mental health issues that doesn‚Äôt exist for physical health issues. And there‚Äôs a stigma attached to taking a controlled substance. Don‚Äôt buy into that nonsense. There‚Äôs no shame in needing help if it improves your life and the lives of the other people in your life. \n\nDoes that answer your question?"

The meds help you be able to divide your attention between various tasks, which is important fir driving, while tuning out irrelevant distractions. You may also find yourself speeding less. \n\nIf you‚Äôre having trouble driving I would definitely be a bit concerned.

I‚Äôve taken endocrinology for my medical training and I know what happens to diabetics who don‚Äôt get their insulin) The glasses analogy is better for someone who is medication friendly and needs a bit of encouragement. \n\nAs an aside, I personally think that the best analogy for ADHD meds to my specific case is my wheelchair. I may be able to walk because I‚Äôm not paralyzed, but my legs freaking suck and if I try and use them to go about my business 99% of the time, I‚Äôll get horrible cramps that‚Äôll ensure that I can‚Äôt even climb the stairs to get back to my apartment. ADHD meds are much more like my wheelchair than glasses, because if I don‚Äôt have them, I‚Äôm not just going around blurry, I‚Äôm doing the equivalent of dragging my body in horrible pain trying to function but practically unable.

They take time to build up in your system, but then they keep working all the time. The delivery mechanism is similar to how antidepressants work. \n\nBut they usually don‚Äôt have anywhere close to the same level of results that you get with stimulants. Stimulants make a huge and immediate difference. Non-stimulants tend to be subtle, and with more variation from person to person. Some people respond a lot better to them than others, and the same is true for the potential side effects.\n\nSo non-stimulants are much better than nothing, and can be very effective when combined with stimulants, but unless you for some reason *can‚Äôt* take stimulants, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend using non-stimulants instead. \n\nSome doctors like to start out with non stimulants first because they are not a controlled substance, so the red tape is easier and there‚Äôs basically no potential for abuse. They‚Äôre also more likely to be covered by insurance than the name brand stimulants. But I think this has more to do with stigma around controlled substances and lack of ADD specific education. I haven‚Äôt seen any literature that actually suggests that‚Äôs most effective.\n\nSo in my opinion (as an official ‚Äúsome asshole on the internet‚Äù) stimulants should be the plan A, with non-stimulants being a backup plan or a supplement. (Combined with other non-medical treatments/management strategies of course, in either case.)"

I generally take it every day unless something goes wrong. \n\nIf I skip my meds for a day it‚Äôs kinda like if you went from 10 cups of coffee a day to zero. I often get a mild headache, sometimes I‚Äôm a bit irritable, and my ADD symptoms are much worse than normal. It‚Äôs unpleasant, and I usually try to keep my work load as low as I can. I also get a serious case of the munchies, so I usually just say fuck it and make that a ‚Äúcheat day‚Äù as far as snacking goes. But it‚Äôs not the end of the world. Coffee or energy drinks help to take the edge off. \n\nI think of it sort of like if I had a 24 hour cold. I‚Äôm not at my best, but I can still do adult stuff if I need to. \n\nIn my case this usually lasts a few days to a week, then I get used to it and I‚Äôm back to my non-medicated baseline. Which is of course not as high functioning as my medicated baseline, but it‚Äôs better than during withdrawal. \n\nBut this is why I don‚Äôt personally take ‚Äúmed vacations‚Äù typically. \n\nAgain though, I want to emphasize that not everyone experiences that. I have several relatives who take pretty much the same meds (some at different doses, some the same) and they don‚Äôt have any negative effects if they skip a dose. They just don‚Äôt get the benefits, but feel fine. \n\nI have also taken different doses and different medications and noticed differing levels of withdrawal if I miss a dose. Usually still some, but it varies. My current dose is on the strong side of normal. \n\nFrom talking with others, and my doctor, my experience is somewhat in the minority but not at all unusual.

Meaning: you can be accompanied by some happy loving feeling. Though probably it‚Äôs more likely to be the head calm and distance from emotions that makes you feel floaty. How do you see it? Ultimately it‚Äôs your experience so I can only make suggestions. \n\nRegarding the distance from emotions: the amphetamine will activate parts of your brain more than others. In particular the ‚Äûgrand manager‚Äú in the prefrontal cortex will be more active (compared to baseline) than the deeper and emotional parts like basal ganglia (I hope I don‚Äôt confuse names here, so read with caution). This is usually the explanation for feeling more in the head (though a calmer version) compared to feeling in some emotionally entangled plate of spaghetti del chaos. Again, there is no right and wrong here. Maybe you like it. Maybe not. Maybe you get used to it, maybe not, or maybe you don‚Äôt even want to get used to it. It‚Äôs your experience, you‚Äôre life, so do what feels right for you (and good thing, it‚Äôs not an irreversible decision)\n\nThen you talk about relearning: that is in fact normal. And it‚Äôs good you realize it. Maybe not everybody has it (yet) but that‚Äôs the idea of stimulant medication and why it usually should (according to all serious publications about the issue) be accompanied by behavioral therapy. If you grow up with only one leg and then comes somebody and hands you a second leg, obviously you have to learn walking before you can run a marathon. Same here. Why don‚Äôt everybody have this then? Because there are plenty other reasons in our environment (say Reddit or other social media for example, but also bad work situations) that trigger adhd symptoms in everybody. Just only temporal compared to true adhd. So depending on your environment and what you already have learned about dealing with these things you still have to deal with those things and so rely on coping mechanisms. \n\nThe. Finally‚Ä¶ what was my finally ü§î‚Ä¶ ah yeah: the trouble driving thing. I would say that‚Äôs again the relearning thing. You experience the world slightly different on meds. So you have to relearn things like driving when having this rather than that type of focus. Nothing impossible. Actually you will likely do so along the way automatically.

We actually have too much attention, and can‚Äôt control it to do what we want. \n\nHyperfocusing is when you are occasionally able to focus exclusively on something, usually something you happen to find interesting, and then suddenly *ALL* your attention is on it. You‚Äôll work through lunch, you‚Äôll forget to pee, you‚Äôll feel like if you stop for even an instant then all will be lost and you‚Äôll never get your focus back (and often that is in fact the case). If someone tries to talk to you, you might not even notice. That‚Äôs hyperfocusing. \n\nIn our hypefocused state we can, in fact, be incredibly productive. We just can‚Äôt always hyperfocus on command, or on the things we *should* be focusing on. I once spent a solid 6 hours researching a boat I had absolutely no intention of buying. \n\nNow, a certain amount of hyperfocusing is normal for ADD, but if you find yourself hyperfocusing too much, or on the wrong things all the time, and being unable to tear yourself away, then it *can* be a sign that you‚Äôre over medicated and may need to dial it back. But again, I have no idea whether that applies to your situation so talk to your doctor."

But at the same time, it cannot be a coincidence that we both heard the same thing a few days apart. Also, I found my pharmacist reliable so there could be something fundamental.\n\nBut here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm more confused. Where can I find an official statement about this?

Curerntly on 50mg but psychiatrist said I can take 70mg on days where I know I really need to get a lot or focus all day. On 50, I can get my paperwork done all day then get housework done at night, im much less impulsive and more emotionally regulated, I calm down a lot faster from being upset. However, my brain still isn't quiet, its just slightly slowed down and I still can't sit still and focus on one thing. However, the first time it tried 70, I had a period of about 1-2 hours where my brain was quiet before it returned to just being a bit slower. I havent had a chance to find out if im able to sit still for long periods and focus on one thing on that dose yet though.\n\nI really don't think 30mg throughout the day is that high. It affects people differently, some respond really well to tiny doses and some only get a small ammount of symptom control from the max dose. Some people dont respond to it at all.\n\nJust trial and error really"
