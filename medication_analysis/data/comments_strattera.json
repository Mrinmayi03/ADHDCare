I'm glad I waited it out as my life is SO MUCH easier on meds. \n\n\nI have now been on it for 8 months and I like it. Boring tasks are doable. My husband is happier and says I'm less forgetful/messy. My job said that I have become more organized and better at emails/paperwork. I noticed I actually pause in my head before saying things and when there's a lull in conversation it doesn't make my skin crawl like it used to. I avoided taking any medicine for my ADHD for 30 years and now I'm pretty annoyed at myself for not doing it sooner."

Bipolar 2).\nIn the beginning and every titration up (except 80mg to 100mg) I had trouble sleeping and woke up with a slight headache. These side effects eventually went away.

    "comment": "Hey - this might be too \"TMI\" to ask (so of course, don't answer if u don't want too), but...\n\nQuestion at end...\n\nWhen i started Lexapro (am still on that as well as others, including Strattera) a couple yrs back, I was aware of the possible sexual function side effects (re: erections); was 58m at the time, now getting close to 60 - JESUS!  LOL\n\nAnyway, i decided to keep records on the frequency of morning erections (now these records have expended to be like a daily journal including a handful of items: how I slept, any dreams, how was the previous day).\n\nMy main reason for keeping track of morning wood was that, because of my ADHD, I would often not be able to stay \"focused\" on the task at hand when me and the Mrs... u know!  :)\n\nMy mind would wander, I'd start thinking about someone that was unfinished at work or something that frustrated me during the day, etc...  talk about a MOOD killer!  (And this was before meds).\n\nI figured, once i started the meds, if I kept track of morning erections (and if they were regular), I'd be able to \"mentally\" de-couple any performance issues linked to my occasional ruminations \"while engaged\" from med linked issues (I.e., if the hydrolics are generally functioning well when sleeping/upon awakening, any issues during \"the event\" are more likely linked to my \"worry\" that things won't work properly, then to any real medication linked issues).\n\nWith all that back story, I am quite surprised, but it is very rare for me to wakeup in the morning without an errction and, typically I will awake in the middle of the night with one as well.\n\nMy question: when you eperinced issues with your own plumbing, was it \"across the boards\" (i,e, few or rare morning erections as well as limited \"usefulness\" when needed?)\n\nThey say that the brain is the biggest sex organ, and I know - even now, after having good records on normal \"functionality\", I still get in my own way, re: my mind ruminating on the occasion, thereby preventing \"lift off\"  :("

    "comment": "For me Strattera has been amazing. BUT..... It honestly made my symptoms worse at first. \n\nMy best way to describe it is that it works the opposite of a stimulant. And as my body habituated to it and pushed to go back to a balance my body increased it's internal stimulation network. Now fully habituated I become a mild ADHD inattentive when I first take it and a few hours later when the dose tapers I become a normal person. I take the Strattera in the morning with a large cup of tea to counteract the initial slowdown and I have a balanced, human normal day. \n\nThat being said, my inattentive ADHD became absolutely terrible the first week. I was so groggy it was scary, I couldn't get anything done and felt so flat I think I now understand what depression is. I only stuck to it because the doctor warned me it takes awhile to work. The second week was worse than normal, but close. The third week things got much better and things got increasingly better until about the 6th week. Now I actually am helping my wife get herself organized whereas she has spent most of our marriage cleaning up after me and making sure I didn't forget things.\n\nWhat I like about is I still feel like me. I think, feel and act like myself. I still am disorganized at times, but it's a choice. And I have been steadily cleaning up my life. Not everything all at once, but nice and steadily making things the way I want.\n\nWhen I tried Ritalin XR, concerta, etc I found I would get an amazing amount of shit done the first few days (but would feel like a robot doing it). Then I would habituate and have to increase the dose. Eventually it would start to screw up my sleep and it would feel like I was taking the pills just to be my ADHD self.\n\nIn conclusion, I absolutely recommend trying Strattera for inattentive ADHD but be prepared for it to actually make things worse at first."

So you’re not even at an effective dose and feeling crappy. It probably would have been a better option to increase your concerta since it was working, just not enough.

Please don’t let the doctor make you feel like you should reconsider and give it more time. Fuck that shit. \n\nI also experienced deal breaking effects on a low dose."

Are these symptoms relatively normal for you, but this is just a lot worse than normal?  Or are these symptoms entirely new for you?  Strattera can cause \"heart and blood vessel problems\", so I unless anxiety driven chest pain and heart palpitations are not unusual for you, I would stop taking it and talk to your doctor ASAP.

    "comment": "It’s not listed as a common symptom but I’d go from no pain in the morning to pain about 5 minutes after taking it. I’m also on Wellbutrin which competes with strattera for metabolic enzymes and I dropped from 450 mg to 300 mg. That didn’t help so I stopped the strattera and then spent the day moping on my bed and an emotional mess so I experimented. I took the strattera and waited. No pain. Took Pristiq, no pain. Took 150 mg Wellbutrin and still no pain so I left it at that and didn’t take more Wellbutrin. \n\nConcerta 36 mg made me exhausted and groggy and feeling awful when I took it along with Wellbutrin and Pristiq and taking 10 mg of adderall got rid of the grogginess. I can also take 72 mg concerta without grogginess. If I completely skip my Wellbutrin while taking Vyvanse it makes me incredibly anxious but it never made me anxious before I started stimulants. I think there are interactions between medications going on behind the scenes and we haven’t identified all of them. We identify when two medications are processed by the same enzyme but we don’t have research on potential interactions for someone on more than 2 meds so if medication A interacts with medication B but only when medication C is also present we don’t have that information. I wonder if SNRIs cause drowsiness when mixed with a low dose of concerta. \n\nIt’s like the science of mental healthcare is a modernist sculpture and each psychiatrist gets something slightly different when they explain the meaning behind that sculpture and it’s not their fault because it’s a frickin modernist sculpture. The artist could have been totally high on acid when they made it making it impossible to understand unless you’re also high on acid."

I do get headaches every time we increase, but they only last for a couple of days. Also, the drowsiness was resolved by taking my medication at night instead of morning.

Once I have a better idea how it will affect me, I might have them raise the dose. Hopefully, it works out.

It mostly just make me extremely tired and I felt like a zombie for the first few weeks, I felt like I became very antisocial.  Then once that regulated.... it was amazing.  My body had a calmness about it and my mind was quiet and relaxed.  I started working on long term goals and had motivation and drive to do things (but not in a stimulated way) everything felt just calm and relaxed and I felt focused.  I didn't get trapped in extreme hyper-focuses.  I was able to start a project and put it down when I needed to and come back to it and resume it.  I was finally able to maintain sobriety (I'm an alcoholic) after self medicating with alcohol for the last 10 years.   I wasn't impulsively spending or binge eating anymore.  I was able to plan my meals and eat when I was hungry and didn't have that mindless snacking or forgetting to eat and then binging once I was over-hungry.  Everything felt great for about 7-9 months with gradual increases in dosages when it started to feel less effective.  I eventually maxed out at 100mg (taking 50mg morn/50mg afternoon) a day and after a short time on that it just seemed to stop working at about 11 months on it.  I noticed when I started recklessly spending and getting trapped in hyper-fixations.  Then all the other things slowly started creeping back in... binge eating, lack of impulsivity, short temper, flightiness and unreliability.  after coming off the strattera I did notice that it did make me constipated, and I would get hot flashes and sweat a lot (I didn't realize how bad it was till I went off it)\n\nI've switched to adderall now, and I hate it.  It only helps with my focus (mostly on things that interest me), but does not give me the all around benefits the strattera did.  It makes me irritable and anxious and fidgety.  I'm hoping to try something else.. or possibly go back on the strattera once I've been off it a while hoping it will have the good effects it did before.\n\nIt was essentially life changing for me, for the time that it worked."

The first few weeks on an SSRI can feel like crap, and same after a dose increase.

I try to take it after breakfast, which for me is usually 10:30, but sometimes forget and take it around lunchtime.\n\nThe start isn't pleasant, and I found the jump between 25 and 40 particularly difficult: that horrible shivery, clammy feeling, and I experienced a few of the unusual sexual side effects (unprompted ejaculation, anyone?!). Not suffered with erectile dysfunction, which was my fear, but have had a few weird \"decoupled orgasms\" which quite a few men report.\n\n After a few weeks at 60mg, I don't notice coming up on it so much. I still feel a bit edgy sometimes - like I've overdone the coffee - but it's generally manageable.\n\nUnfortunately I don't feel it's making a huge difference to my ADHD symptoms. Maybe I thought it would be a silver bullet, but I still really struggle with distraction, task initiation, focus etc.\n\nSleep-wise, on the lower doses I feel like I slept much better and was refreshed in the mornings. At 60mg, I'm kinda tired all day but absolutely shattered come evening when it's wearing off. I sleep restlessly - though with lots of memorable dreams - but really struggle to get out of bed in the mornings, not ideal for someone with a working spouse and school-age kids.\n\nOn the positive side, after an initial period of feeling extra irritable, I think it's made my mood more even, but that doesn't feel like an adequate payoff for the lack of impact on the ADHD and the exhaustion.\n\nI'm going to persist for a few more months, but I'm hoping my doctor will let me try stimulant meds next - though, to be completely honest, weed seems to be the most effective thing for me, so I may also try the medical cannabis route. I'm in the UK so this is probably harder to access."

That might help!\n\nThey also were about to lower my dose after I told them I was too tired. A lot of people take their dose at night and they say that helps but I never got that far.\n\nHow did you convince them to give you a lower dose right off the bat? I tried asking for that because I'm so sensitive to all medications and they wouldn't work with me. They said it couldn't go lower."

Not even with food—like eat a full meal and then take the meds. I usually take my Strattera at lunch and that helps a lot because I’ve had breakfast and it’s been several hours. \n\nAlso I like seltzer water it can help with any stomach discomfort that Strattera causes. \n\nOverall it’s annoying but worth it to have a medication that works without stimulants."

I’m not sure why they said they wouldn’t lower it for you. They have lower doses available? From what I understand looking at the paperwork that came with the prescription, and what other people have said, the target dose is 80mg, sure, but they don’t expect you to start at that, and there’s no reason you can’t start lower than the standard starting dose of 40mg, either. That’s bizarre. Doctors are weird, is what I’ve been learning, recently. My doctor told me that it would be okay for me miss doses, if I don’t need them certain days, but from what I’ve been learning about it, no, that isn’t the case? It works by building up in your system over time, so missing doses would just delay seeing real results?\nAnyway, what dose were you at?"

My wife's a psychologist and works with a psychiatrist who specialises in ADHD and addiction (a disproportionate number of UK prisoners have undiagnosed ADHD and drug and alcohol problems) and he told her that it's a shit drug for ADHD, whereas stims have a much higher success rate. \n\nI think my doc started me on non-stims as I was honest about my recreational drug use (daily cannabis, moderate alcohol, infrequent MDMA and cocaine etc.) but I've asked to change so let's see."

My ejaculation and orgasm was dissynchronized , ejaculation would begin 5-10 seconds before orgasm, and actually there were no orgasm at all, rather pain. My testicles were tensed and aching.

Good to know I should expect to up my dosage if symptoms don't continue to improve.\n\nI've had a few minor side effects like having to pee more often, thinking I had a UTI, and one that I'd rather not get into that is starting to go away.\n\nI'm 36, denied that I had ADHD from about 16 to about 32. Didn't like how Concerta made me feel back in the day and thought it was just to get me to shut up and sit still. I thought I was one of the kids that got overdiagnosed. Took me that long to realize I did have the condition and it had been impacting my life the whole time! Took me an extra 4 years to find out that it's \"the most treatable psychiatric condition\" according to Dr. Barkley.\n\nSo, yeah, now I'm on Strattera because I still don't want to take a stimulant (other than coffee🙃 ).\n\nTL;DR thanks for sharing your experience.

Some people say it eventually settled down, others have had to discontinue.  Is anyone here experiencing increased heart rate?"

My side effects weren't too bad except for the 40MG headache, and 80mg is still working wonders for me with now no side effects. My psych told me the max dose for adults is 100MG, so I'd say it isn't the drug for you if it isn't working at least a little bit at 80mg. \n\nIt is really subtle change though so for question #1.. I'd say you never know unless you give each dose at least a couple week chance before moving up in dose, if side effects outweigh the benefits it isn't the drug for you."

    "comment": "I like Strattera. Was on it for a few months while I waited for an ADHD evaluation. Confirmed ADHD combined type. Psychiatrist recommended switching to Concerta for more effective management. So my family doctor did the switch. I hated Concerta. It lasts 10-12 hours then crash and zombie land. Tons of bad side effects. So, back on Strattera 60mg and realizing that while it may not manage 100% my distractedness and impulsivity, it  does about 75% and I have the personal resources to handle it. It has a calming effect on my anxiety and racing thoughts, and also on my emotional reactions. Had some side effects initially the first time I was on Strattera but they went away after 3-4 weeks. Takes a couple of months to get full effect but it is a slow gradual process and I am happy with the result. Work is better focused and less prone to distraction seeking. Now on my second time and purring away happy with this med. Not for everyone but nor are any of the options. Finding the best fit may take trial and error but you got this!!!! Good luck and hope this works for you"

I am starting the NDRI Strattera not taking anything else (unmedicated) in the last 6 months. Hopefully the side effects aren't bad, they sound like those I experienced on a totally different drug Naltrexone which was rough.\n\nIn the past I took Bupropion - Wellbutrin XR 150. I found initially starting on it uncomfortable, and a little speedy, or like something was going to kick in but doesn't. I had minimal effects : positive or negative over the years so I switched off.  After starting an SSRI, Zoloft, I had male sexual dysfunction. I found reintroducing the SNRI Bupropion solved that.  I am curious how Strattera would interact with Bupropion but not knowledgeable on it.  I went off of both same time cold turkey with minimal discomfort.\n\nIt was my understanding that dopamine was important for ADHD treatment, and that stimulants had an indirect impact on dopamine.  So I am left to wonder does Strattera alone not help dopamine? It would seem from the name NDRI that Bupropion does impact dopamine."

I took 40mg yesterday for the first time, today again and I definitely feel more calm, I have more space between a thought and a reaction. Before that I would barely think about something and it would be automatically followed by anxiety spike in my chest and as I would get 100s of these mini spikes during the day, it weared me off to the point of exhaustion in the afternoon. The only possible side effect I feel is that I feel a goosebumps over my body a bit more than usual (it's winter here and I sit next to window) and I still don't really have that much motivation and I feel a bit spaced out, but because I don't feel the immediate stong anxiety before starting a task, I am finding myself rolling into the task somehow and I'm not getting angry during doing the task. I hope it slowly builds up and then my dosage at 80mg will improve it further, but who knows. I also didn't have a coffee yesterday and today to be able to distinguish the drug influence, so I also might have some caffeine withdrawal."

It's definitely rare to see much improvement at the low doses. 60mg-80mg is considered the therapeutic range that you're supposed to taper up to although sometimes if needed it can also go up to slightly higher doses. Usually the dose is increased every 1-2 weeks or maybe a month if the lower doses are causing side effects. Taking 10mg that long isn't really *supposed* to do anything if everything is going well"

From what I've heard and is mentioned in this thread, some side effects are too severe to even try and continue. Side effects for me happened nearly immediately while benefits took a week or two.

He told me that bupropion would help for that but also out of all the NDRI out there bupropion had the largest dopamine profile. I never had strattera though but what I heard was the nor adrenaline was the larger profile. Still has the dopamine but not as large. \n\nI totally get the feeling of the stim chase thing. It just never crosses that line but it has that push so frustrating. They maxed me out of it 300mg and it gave me crazy heart palps. Like couldn't exercise or ride my bike without gagging. Not until my dad girlfriend saw it, she was a cardiac nurse, did I realize it was body trying to sync my heart with the gagging because of the heart palp. So stopped that and it took a years to get a doctor to actually get me back on my Adderall. I never should have quit it in the first place. I thought I could beat the ADHD but no way that happened. Just a long struggle for over a decade to get back on a medication I took for years. Was always asked why I wasn't on it from the doctors. I told them I quit because I thought I didn't need it. They were always suspicious of that. Never knew why and what they put in my file? I never abused it, lost a script or tried to fill before my window.

I do definitely have adhd though, considering my family history (my mom and my brother on her side have adhd, and my brother on my dad's side is suspected to and hasn't done anything yet). they're all just like me and I can see a huge similarity in their symptoms and what I experience.

Medications that increase dopamine increase norepinephrine by default so it can be hard to break down exactly what part is most beneficial.

I can understand one being wary of prescribing stimulants, but Strattera or Wellbutrin are both non-addictive drugs and both are known to help ADHD symptoms. (Though Wellbutrin didn't work for me - just wanted to add it here since it works for others). I was diagnosed in my early teens.. umm.. I think around 20 years ago? There was no \"testing\" exactly, was basically - \"Hey I have these symptoms and here's my family history\" (My dad and sister are both diagnosed with ADHD), and they were like \"Ok! Here's you're issue!\". Ofc was more in-depth than that but man your psych sounds unexperienced and unprofessional and probably doesn't even believe ADHD exists like many out there don't believe in it. I wish you luck on Thursday.\n\nEdit: Wanted to add I live in the US and with COVID that happened the fact online psychs being popular have really helped me to make appointments as I have a lot of anxiety with people. I currently use Teladoc since my insurance covers them. Another good one is Talkspace IMO. However they do not prescribe stimulants like Adderall if that is what you are looking for."

    "comment": "Yes they do and so does depression in fact. Dopamine and attention/focus is well tested with many drug classes and disorders for focus and reward system. Got to get the dam thing to release and good luck without reward system kicking in.  My drugs and behavior class at OSU (neuroscience guy) we went over much of this and why these drugs exist since the safety profile of dopamine releasers are very safe over the then novel reuptake inhibiting. Well it main reason is getting abused not because they don't work. There will always be exceptions to the rule though so not saying people can always tolerate it but from what I saw reuptake was a bigger problem for the feeling bad thing. It is laying more and more in your neural synapsis, it pools and has chances to attach somewhere it shouldn't. The releasing much less so, absorption is not inhibited conversion is not inhibited . but once again abuse potential is much higher. So they come up something less abusing potential and that is reuptake inhibitors. I don't agree that dopamine is not the focus and attention getter. I do agree that it does help though I mean all 3 neurotransmitters ( or hormones) effect each other. The three boats all ride the same wave idea. We will just have to agree to disagree on which boat is actually doing the work. Have a good one friend ❤️"

Driving does suck, I hate it, luckily I have a husband who understands and does most of it for me.\n\nI am actually unemployed and in full-time school now, Strattera has really helped with it. I am in an online school that has their terms start every 1st of the month. Why not try something that works for you for a month and do something similar?

Same for low-functioning. In my opinion, it's good for a quick way to describe how autism impacts someone, but some autistic people may disagree with me. Definitely do some research into what autism is and it's symptoms! there are some online tests, but definitely don't fully rely on them. Do know that autism and adhd are comorbid very often, though! (Never, under any circumstances, use autism speaks as a resource).\n\nI'm doing two community college classes now, and I major in health Sciences.

Wellbutirn was added after I was diagnosed with ADHD and honestly, i tdidn't notice a huge change but that might also be because I'm in my late 40's and brain fog is just a normal daily hormonal thing these days. \n\nHowever, my 11 yo son is on Strattera after trying Focalin (no appetite & major crash), Concerta (no appetite, but better focus in class), Astarys (just generally did not feel good) and then we asked to try a non stimulant. We started on 10mg, to 18mg, and now he's on 25mg of generic Strattera and I think it's finally leveled out after the past 3 months. He's more cooperative, less anxious, able to eat and has appetite, better in school for the most part, and overall just easier going.

Otherwise no real noticeable side effects. \n\nI don't feel that it's helping my memory/concentration/motivation.....but it's so hard to tell because throughout my monthly cycle I can have great weeks and abysmal weeks when unmedicated. So maybe it's helping sometimes.\n\nI do think it has helped my anxiety and racing thoughts. I'm probably going to ask my doc about upping the dose.\n\nI've always taken it in the morning and never felt drowsy from it. And it doesn't disrupt my sleep either."

I have to take adderall on an empty stomach, then eat about 45/60 minutes after taking a dose (no less than 45 mins because the adderall will be useless, no more than 60 mins because then I’ll feel nauseous and possibly get a headache). No exaggeration, if I take it after eating or eat immediately after, It’s like not taking it at all. That’s why the xr is useless for me, because I’m not able to make sure my stomach is empty whenever the medication is released in the xr, cuz I don’t know when that’ll happen. I also make sure I don’t consume any citric acid around the times I take it. Doing those 2 things made all the difference in the world and It’s why only the adderall ir works for me. You could be in a similar situation."

Anyway, it still feels great. It feels like an innate drive to do things, rather than the almost \"artificial\" feeling I got from stimulants. If you take it at night, beware of insomnia. Switch to taking it in the mornings immediately if it happens. But it does make some people drowsy, so ymmv. I started at 40 for 2 weeks, felt nothing, went up to 60, felt different in a week. Give it a month to work before you come to any conclusions. 60 seems to be the standard dose for adults. If you are smaller or younger you might have a lower overall dose than I do, so stay in touch with your prescriber. A lower starting dose may also be harder to notice at first, so give yourself a good amount of time to try it before scrapping it. I'm 23 and 135lbs if that helps. Good luck and I hope it goes well.

If I have a bite to eat before I take it, I swear it’s useless. My doctor thinks my schedule is crazy, but I swear it’s the only way I’ll get out of bed and get moving. So I’ve mentioned to my doctor how I feel like adderall xr overall does nothing for me. We’ve upped my dosage a few times..nothing really changes. But she always does XR so it “helps all day,” but I don’t feel that at all. How do I ask for IR? I don’t even really understand what IR is, if I’m being honest."

I MUST take it with food in the morning or suffer. And a piece of toast won’t cut it, I need a rather complete breakfast.\n\nBut with Strattera I felt like my impulse control was much better.  I am much more deliberate in my decision making, I feel in control of my days instead of being led from thing to thing.  Like, from my first day I was like, “oh wow, this is how normal people feel all the time!”\n\nOh, it does have a pronounced affect on my appetite as well, so if you have problems getting enough calories in during a day normally, this may present a challenge for you. \n\nAsk me anything else!

What this thing did not help with at all is the sense of time, I still need loads of external beacons (watch, timers, stopwatches) not to stray from the initial plan. I broke both of elbows a month ago and spend some time not being able to habitually use the watch due to casts, and I was like flowing in jello literally not knowing what time is, how much have passed. But again, I doubt that it’s something medication can change at all, the environment only. And as you have at least a bit higher chance to maintain your environment suiting your needs on the meds, everything becomes better. I am not miraculously feeing like I do not have ADHD, however, am a bit more in control of my life, lacking other words to describe it. \n\nSo to sum up, considering that stimulants are not available in my country, I am satisfied with my choice to try atomo.

    "comment": "The “IR” in Adderall IR stands for immediate release. The “XR” in Adderall XR stands for extended release. So with the IR version of Adderall, you get the full dose of what you take all at once. Usually you’ll take a morning dose, then an afternoon dose. Which allows you to know what time your meds will kick in, so you can plan your meals accordingly so that the meds will actually be effective, and you still get to eat. With the XR version of Adderall, you get half the dose right away, then the other half releases some time later (causing it to “last all day”). I would just be upfront about it, explain that the XR meds feel ineffective for you. You could say that you did some reading about Adderall and kept coming across other people’s experiences where they found their Adderall xr to be ineffective due to not taking it on an empty stomach and not being able to make sure their stomach was empty when the extended portion of the dose was released. And that you’d like to stop taking the xr and give a twice a day dose of the immediate release version of adderall a shot so that you are better in control of when you take the meds in relation to when you eat and see if that makes a difference."

It's no longer considered best practice; some doctors used to favor this to avoid health complications but studies have shown stimulants produce better health outcomes. As long as it's done as a patient preference and not the doctor being superstitious about meds there are plenty of reasons. The health benefits of stimulants are really well demonstrated, so from a psychiatrist's perspective daily use should be favored, but not necessarily mandatory. As a patient though, sometimes you just need a break from the side effects. \n\nThe thing about you taking days off for tolerance is that tolerance problems are not well demonstrated by the research. Some people just need high doses of meds for them to remain effective every day, and for some people that dose might even be above the recommended max dose. So if your schedule is working for you, no need to fix what ain't broke. But generally a doctor should be trying to raise that dose until you don't need days off to function. And of course, not everyone can take those high doses and still feel well. \n\nHere in the real world, does your doctor want to pick a fight with a pharmacist every month? Does that pharmacist who deleted all their comments balk when they see high doses of stimulants? Days off for tolerance solves practical problems in the real world for some folks."

I took Vyvanse for a year and a half and it personally worsened my substance abuse problems. I switched to Strattera 2 months ago and it's been life-changing + I've stopped drinking altogether. Just letting you know before you even begin your ADHD treatment journey, that if stimulants ever don't work out for you, that also doesn't mean you don't have ADHD (i.e., because stimulants affected me negatively, I got horrible imposter syndrome and questioned my diagnosis for months). But, if this happens to you, it could just be that you need a non-stimulant alternative that works better for you!  \n  \nBest of luck in finding a doctor who validates your experience, which is what you deserve!

    "comment": "> I needed to be diagnosed before 12\n\nThe DSM-V-TR includes this diagnostic criterion for ADHD:\n\n> Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were present prior to age 12 years.\n\nThe Diagnostic Features go on to say:\n\n> In adults, hyperactivity may manifest as extreme restlessness or wearing others out with their activity. Impulsivity refers to hasty actions that occur in the moment without forethought, which may have potential for harm to the individual (e.g., darting into the street without looking). Impulsivity may reflect a desire for immediate rewards or an inability to delay gratification. Impulsive behaviors may manifest as social intrusiveness (e.g., interrupting others excessively) and/or as making important decisions without consideration of long-term consequences (e.g., taking a job without adequate information).\n>\n>ADHD begins in childhood. The requirement that several symptoms be present before age 12 years conveys the importance of a substantial clinical presentation during childhood. At the same time, an earlier age at onset is not specified because of difficulties in establishing precise childhood onset retrospectively (Kieling et al. 2010). Adult recall of childhood symptoms tends to be unreliable (Klein et al. 2012; Mannuzza et al. 2002), and it is beneficial to obtain ancillary information. ADHD cannot be diagnosed in the absence of any symptoms prior to age 12. \n>\n> ADHD cannot be diagnosed in the absence of any symptoms prior to age 12. \n\nIt does *not* require that you had been diagnosed, just that symptoms were present. And it does *not* contraindicate that an adult can be diagnosed with ADHD. It even describes what to look for.\n\n> since I was a “gifted” kid and went through eng school and have a successful career it wouldn’t make sense to be ADHD\n\nLots of ADHD people were \"gifted\". Lots are accomplished academically and have successful careers. This is an offensive stereotype. Here are just two papers that Dr. Google could find easily:\n\n- [ADHD and giftedness: a neurocognitive consideration of twice exceptionality](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23428302/)\n- [Professionally successful adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): Compensation strategies and subjective effects of pharmacological treatment](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5619157/)\n\n> that people being diagnosed later in life is just doctor google and only a loud minority\n\nNo, she has an axe to grind that flies in the face of current accepted psychiatry.\n\nYour doctor may or may not be right that an ASD diagnosis is more appropriate than an ADHD diagnosis. She may be right that it would be imprudent to prescribe you stimulants when you have AUD. I don't know. I don't claim to be a doctor.\n\nBut I don't need to be a doctor to know that the things she's saying about ADHD are wrong.\n\nI don't think it would be productive to try to make any of these points. Can you find another psychiatrist?"

As a former gifted child who excelled in school, now has a fancy schamcy corporate job where I rub elbows with top of house executives, and was formally diagnosed in my late 20's - tell that psych to kick rocks and find someone better at their job.\n\nIt's not our fault that ADHD was initially studied in young boys almost exclusively. Women and girls (not sure if your gender, but late in life diagnoses are more common for women) are woefully missed because of how symptoms present differently. Late diagnoses are happening more now BECAUSE of the \"loud minority\" screaming that the historic representation of ADHD is so inaccurate. Now more symptoms are recognized by doctors and the public (if either bother to listen).\n\nThe gifted student bit really grinds my gears, though. Some ADHD people thrive in school. There's a reason so many of us ended up being diagnosed with ADHD, ASD, etc. Learning has always been a passion of mine, so of course I could hyper focus on course materials. I do better with body doubling, so being around the other students all day helped my executive function. Plus I am more likely to meet goals and deadlines if I'm being held accountable externally.

My whole life I’ve been misdiagnosed and given medication that at one point almost made me commit simply because I wasn’t suppose to take it. Only a few months ago I decided to look into a adhd diagnosis and luckily my partner already had a psychiatrist whose specialty is adhd in adults. I was diagnosed on the first visit from how obvious it was for her. Btw I was overlooked my whole life because the kind of adhd I had was the chatty kind that doodled a lot compared to the disruptive kind that couldn’t sit in chairs. As soon as I began my medication it instantly felt “normal”. It’s difficult to imagine how I even finished school without them now. I’m also working on dbt on the non medicinal aspect of adhd.

Took the 4 hour test, was diagnosed with ADHD, cyclical mood disorder, and anxiety. That was in September, they prescribed me stimulants in January of this year. I am 32M with 2 kids and one on the way, I have about a half finished engineering degree, went to gifted school in high school and finished AP classes.

I grew up in a physically, mentally, and sexually abusive household. I have often been asked how I survived this long, this well with everything that has happened, and my current diagnosis, and my response is always the same “what was I going to do, fail? I have nothing to go back to, so I can only go forward.” My son has Autism AND ADHD. You can have more than one thing, and it’s fairly common.

Being intelligent or having some form of substance use disorder are not exclusion criteria for ADHD, not to mention many very intelligent people have ADHD, and unfortunately ADHD is a risk factor for substance use. \n\n2. There are multiple studies that demonstrate a correlation between ADHD increasing your risk of addiction. Likewise, multiple studies also correlate addressing ADHD with reduction in substance use. That said, neurocognitive testing does require you to be sober to be valid for evaluating ADHD.\n\n3. Many of us were diagnosed much later. It’s not like working memory issues simply disappear after age 12. \n\n4. Stimulant use isn’t contraindicated entirely due to prior substance use. For someone who has been able to get sober, it is reasonable to use stimulants to help maintain that sobriety if also diagnosed with ADHD; it does require pretty close follow up with your provider, given stimulants are schedule 2. A provider may one first want to use a non-stimulant first, but it’s not completely out of the question to jump to stimulants."

Symptoms must be present before 12, not a diagnosis.\n2. Gifted kiddos are able to mask their difficulties more effectively in the school environment and professional environments. \n3. Alcoholism, anxiety, and depression are all highly correlated with ADHD and ASD. A good psychologist will construct a timeline of symptoms and diagnoses to see what came first. AND to diagnose ASD without fully evaluating ADHD is just poor practice— if you have ASD there is a 50-70% chance you also have ADHD. \n4. When looking for a doctor I recommend a psychologist, one who is probably a bit younger. Psychology today.com will let you search for providers who provide testing and evaluation.

That is incredibly hard to do when you have mood disorders like anxiety and depression, because they will have to medicate/treat you for those first before being able to assess you for adhd (which yeah, is ridiculous since I’m sure for many of us the other issues are partially exacerbated or caused by the adhd for sure, but it is what it is). For my partner, the psych settled on just prescribing Wellbutrin because it’s used to treat anxiety and is sometimes used off label for adhd, and even tho she was never truly given an adhd diagnosis, the psych was also able to give her stimulants to help counter her inability to focus as a symptom (but she has no substance use issues to make that a problem).

Psychiatrists are just gate keepers in my experience. I had a really bad psychiatrist who refused to get me assessed despite my plethora of symptoms and experiences like ; Couldn’t keep a job, did poorly in school, several SSRI’s didn’t work for me and often made symptoms worse, making impulsive decisions consistently ect. He finally gave me a referral for the assessment after pushing him for months and putting me on medications that made me sick. When I asked him for the 20th time I was bawling so I guess that helped (use crying to your advantage folks) The amazing woman who assessed me was astounded I haven’t been diagnosed before. I now have a very supportive psychiatrist who understands the complexities of adhd. However I was not able to get assessed for autism since I was verbal (much harder to get assessed for as an adult)"

I barely needed to study, incredibly smart, had a scholarship to attend a private girl’s school (lost for an unrelated reason), finished my work early; you name it. I was always praised as being very smart. I carried an almanac everywhere with me and I loved to skim through the dictionary. my vocabulary was higher than average and again, just amazed by my teachers. once middle school had arrived, I didn’t coast by so much or at all; especially in math. I had to study and things weren’t so easily retainable. they also changed to common core which certainly, did me in further. what got me overlooked was that, my race, assigned gender, being naturally inquisitive, and labeled as a “chatty girl” because I talked so much. there might be other behaviors I exhibited but I still was able to be diagnosed. none of the reasoning provided by the psychiatrist makes sense."

I think now that I might be, but I 100% have ADHD.\n\n\nMy mother finally told me that my elementary school referred me several times for an ADHD eval, but my mother never took me in for it because she didn't want me to have the stigma. However, she did send me all of the report cards and things that showed my academic skills were \"superior\" but my effort and behavior were always marked as \"needs improvement.\"\n\n\nI went back to a child psychologist who basically only does ADHD and autism evals. There was no one who worked with adults who was qualified to do ADHD evals, and he said they don't usually evaluate adults, but he was willing to mostly because I had documentation from elementary school. \n\n\nOnce I had the diagnostic report, from a doctor everyone else in town seemed to know, I had no trouble finding a psychiatrist who would treat me.\n\n\nSo, I would talk to your parents, if possible and find out if any of your teachers had concerns, or if they have any of your academic records. Evidence from childhood might help. Second, call around and see if you can find someone trained to evaluate kids who is willing to do the eval. \n\n\nIf you can't do that, there are non-stimulant medications that you can take to help with symptoms, too, so it might be helpful to explore that."

ADHD, etc.) 2 major additional things I can see here: \n\n1.  ADHD has been known to be a major factor in both comorbidity and potential causal issues re. depression and/or anxiety issues (mood disorders).\n\nIt is a complex dynamic; one in which you deserve qualified prescribers, therapists (everyone on your treatment team) to not only be aware of, but know their responsibilities to (a) understand, and (b) help you with (in order for any form of treatment to truly take place or be successful).\n\nThis is “101” enough (and has been since at least the early 1990’s, arguably earlier…) that this is not only very disconcerting, but not acceptable for any standard of care.\n\nIn other words: No one deserves an accountant that not only can’t do math, but with actually steal from you and/or get you in trouble with the IRS. Likewise:  No one deserves a falsehood of a ‘treatment provider’ that is not only NOT qualified to provide care, but is causing and will continue to cause harm.\n\n2.  Your listed points (thank you for that btw): Every single one they made is objectively false. None of this is true, based on literal decades of scientific psychological research and study.\n\n[This person is some kind of con in some form or another. I don’t know specifics, but this is alarming. Nor the DSM (US) or ICD (global) supports these wildly inaccurate and irresponsible claims]\n\nI’m speaking up bc anyone who enters the field of healthcare takes an oath to cause no harm, and this is not only ineffective, it is harmful. It is also quite frankly so ignorant that I would question their licensure and educational background…\n\nThankfully, there are (still) providers in most states (if you are in the US) that really know what they are doing, and also want to provide as much effective and accessible/affordable healthcare as possible.\n\nI know it is easy for people to be alarmist (or worse) etc. from behind screens (ie on social media), but I would strongly - STRONGLY -  suggest you find new care asap.\n\nI don’t know you personally (obvi), but I’m not sure you should go back. I wouldn’t myself, nor would I want a loved one to. Ultimately, only you know what is best for you, but this is very alarming stuff. \n\nAccording to what info we have; This wasn’t just poor/not good enough care, it was fundamentally false and (most importantly) inevitably harmful in nature. \n\nI wish you the best, and I hope you don’t have to see this person again and can find a qualified professional that is honoring their Hippocratic oath, and not actively spreading misinformation/lies/the fundamental opposite of treatment and healthcare.\n\nI’m sorry you are having to deal with this, and that it’s happening at all in 2025. Hope this helps, stay safe, and thank you for sharing. \n\n💙"

The people I work with are intimidatingly smart and successful, even by my high standards. If I had to guess how many of them have ADHD, I think 25% would be a good starting point, but it could be substantially more. It's massively higher than in the population at large, and is demonstrably not an impediment to succeeding in school or having a successful career.\n\nThere is literally a podcast where they interview successful people who have ADHD. Many have founded or run large multinational companies. It's insulting to believe that ADHD makes it impossible to do these things, or that being successful is a reason to eliminate ADHD as a potential diagnosis.\n\nBeing *currently* inebriated would probably be a valid reason not to test someone at that moment in time, since it obviously affects your cognition. But drinking alcohol ever is not and makes no sense. How long do they insist that someone abstain from alcohol for before they will permit them to take an assessment for ADHD?

An autism diagnosis before ADHD is stupid in my opinion because there is actually medication that can help significantly with ADHD, whereas autism only has coping strategies which are likely much more ineffective even if you have both because the ADHD will be hindering you. \n\nAs for the final points about alcohol, I can’t weigh in that much because I have never had a drinking problem. But I can say they likely won’t prescribe if you are actively drinking. And for good reason ADHD meds and alcohol do not mix (or atleast the ones I have been on). However this should have no effect on getting a diagnosis and in fact the addiction to alcohol can even be a sign/result of ADHD."

No, I was just gaslit my whole life into thinking I was lazy and unmotivated when I always wanted to be better.\n\nUndiagnosed ADHD leading to anxiety and depression is a very common thing. Some people just can't imagine what it's like to see things come so naturally to those around them when, for you, it feels like an uphill battle all the time. They don't know what it's like to feel like you're struggling to survive where others are effortlessly thriving.\n\nI remember telling my therapist that it wasn't anxiety keeping me from succeeding. It was my struggle to keep up with success that made me anxious. It wasn't depression keeping me from getting things done. It was my inability to keep up with my goals that made me feel depressed about how far behind I felt.\n\nYou need a new doctor who actually listens. If they want to say you don't have something, it should be after careful evaluation, not some outdated opinions."

Not sure where she got her degree from but this is not a new idea.  2) is gatekeeping your access to diagnostic testing which is a big red flag.\n\nI CAN agree with your provider that sometimes the line between ADHD and autism spectrum is blurry and that many people who believe they have ADHD or only ADHD may be on the spectrum, but she isn’t testing you for THAT either so that leads me to the final conclusion:\n\nYou need to get a second opinion, I know shopping for psychiatric practitioners is one of the most horrible things you can do in life but if you have the option I would take it.  It sounds like your current provider is very satisfied that she ‘knows what your deal is and case closed’, that’s not a great attitude to take and at the moment that you wrote this post I would argue that it was actively doing you harm.  For your own peace of mind you should find a backup practitioner and inquire about testing for either or both (I’d personally recommend both) and then wait for the results.\n\nWishing you the best, I’m so sorry you ran into this situation OP.  I hope you can get back to a place of trust and confidence in both yourself and your practioner"

Get a new psych.  \n\n\n\n* You don't need to be diagnosed by any particular age, lots of things can shape how you behave and act and present to the world (I was diagnosed in my 40s) \n* That's just, like, her opinion, man. Isn't the very purpose of seeing a psych to dig into your mind and see what's going on in there?\n* I was a gifted kid (and then later a very, very heavy self-medicater) and a general success in careers, so that made it very easy for people to overlook the distractibility. (My first grade teacher brought me tons and tons of word find puzzle books because I always finished my tests and quizzes first and then sat there, squirming in my seat.)\n* I was diagnosed by a neurologist, so I think that person probably knows a bit about brain development and issues and wasn't going on google (what a dismissive asshat statement to make) \n* What the ever living hell does alcohol have to do with anything in her mind? You might drink less when you're medicated. Again, I drank heavily as a means of self-medicating, looking for that peace and quiet moment when I had dulled all my senses and it was quiet in my head, and by drinking heavily, I mean a fifth of gin or tequila or whiskey a night was *casual drinking* for me.\n* Look, people all the time bang on about ADHD drugs being stimulants. It's like the world's tiniest dose of stimulant. I feel less stimulated by my morning dose of meds than I do by a single espresso. Standard dose for Adderall XR is 20mg taken once, sometimes twice a day. I take a 20mg first thing in the morning and a 20mg in the early afternoon. The range for a lethal dose is based on kilograms of body weight. For me that'd be 1,500mg (around 75 of my XRs). If you have a cardiac condition, then that's something to be aware of or an amphetamine/stimulant sensitivity. But for the average person, the amount of stimulant in every single prescribed ADHD medicine is a tiny drop. It's an overly cited worry, used to justify denial of medication, absent any actual real reason. This psych is diagnosing based on vibes and that shit is bogus."

He is a retired clinical psychologist who specializes in ADHD. He has mountains of research and presentations on his YouTube channel. He goes over this exact situation. I have an engineering degree. I’m successful. I’ve been married 30 years, raised three kids. ADHD just slapped me in the face. I slapped back. I went to my GP and opened up to him and told him what I was going through. He assessed me per the DSM 5 and diagnosed me as ADHD Combined. He’s been working with me closely on my meds and has been very supportive. \n\nIf your doctor won’t listen to you and address your concerns after you have clearly and specifically stated what is going on with you then kick her to the curb. \n\nEverything you have described is classic adhd undiagnosed. \n\nYou be your own best advocate. If a doctor won’t help then move on."

    "comment": "When I was in college for Youth and Childcare, we learned a lot about ADHD and criteria for diagnosis. This was almost 10 years ago, so I think things are changing now, but the diagnosis criteria actually stated the person in review HAD to show problematic symptoms as a child to get a diagnosis as an adult. As in, completely regardless of a professionals opinion, if in the review the person says they had no symptoms of ADHD and had no issues around any areas, they could not diagnose them with ADHD full stop. \n\nI was diagnosed as an adult myself, but had a history of teachers recommending to my parents to have me tested as a child. And had low grades throughout the majority of my 12 years. \n\nAlso, just as a side note, I very rarely ever drink, but on a single occasion I had one day drink while on vacation a few hours after taking my Vyvanse, and I was wasted. A single Mikes and I was heavily intoxicated. I'm 6'2 250. And was slurring my words after. So, while I really hope you find the answers you're looking for, I know from personal experience Vyvanse and alcohol are no good"

Although it DID take learning what the symptoms were and recognizing them in myself (and in my history as a child) to make it even possible for me to suggest an evaluation in the first place.\n\nI was also gifted in school and didn't struggle too terribly much there or in college, and I have maintained a career. It means I managed to cope and succeed despite the ADHD, not that I don't have it.\n\nAll of that is just dumb, TBH. \n\nI wasn't diagnosed before 12 because ONLY the wild crazy uncontrollable boys got diagnosed at ALL back then. Girls just didn't, especially with the inattentive type. Are we supposed to believe that nearly no women before the what, late 90's? had ADHD? Ever? \n\nBeing diagnosed means recognizing the symptoms, putting together that they add up to ADHD, being willing to look into a diagnosis, being able to afford a diagnosis, etc. So kids whose parents are neglectful, or poor, or uneducated about ADHD, or don't believe in mental health, or whatever can't have ADHD because they won't get diagnosed before 12? \n\nI think your Psych is either uninformed or biased. Or doesn't want to take the time to do ADHD evaluations. But she's definitely just discounting your reality without any basis if she won't even have you so much as go through the basic ADHD questions!"

You can't just not take the Adderall on the weekend and drink and expect to get no toxicity effects because you missed a day or two. That's not how drugs work and definitely not how toxicity works.\n4. All of this \"advice\" in this thread seems cursory at best and heavily on the topic of Adderall. Seek a licensed therapist and/or psychiatrist for questions and medication adjustments.\n\nIt bothers me that in an ADHD forum, the predominant advice is \"take a pill for it\". That doesn't work for everyone, it's low quality advice, and it really doesn't acknowledge or ask questions about anything remotely related to what symptoms OP is experiencing, or the cross referencing of ASD.

I know of a doctors, plural, who have adhd, and many people are now diagnosed in adulthood. Don’t waste your time trying to convince this doctor of your position, a doctor who is as misinformed as yours on adult ADHD will be unlikely to acknowledge how far off track they are. Any attempt to enlighten him/her will likely deteriorate into a battle of egos from your doctor’s perspective. With all that is known about adult ADHD today, your doctor’s ignorance is potentially willful, and you are unlikely to be able to change that. Find a psychiatrist with experience treating adult ADHD, some even assess remotely, and get a proper assessment."

It seems like they have an issue with ADHD and shouldn't be working in that area. \n\nWhen I was having issues with this re: had to have shown up in my life before 12 (I was diagnosed at 49), I had to pull out specific things when getting diagnosed that spoke to the fact this had always been an issue prior to now. For instance:\n\n- I was very impulsive - I fractured my arm because I stepped out of a tree to reach an apple when I was about 7. \n- As soon as I went to college my grades plummeted, likely because of the lack of any structure to my schooling beyond what I added. I could go to class or not, etc.\n-i often got in trouble in class for talking or having laughing fits.\n-there was a lot of trauma and masking I had to do regarding my extended family, so controlling how I appeared to others was very important and something I was used to doing.\n\nI am sober now so that didn't factor into my diagnosis or medication decisions.\n\nPulling out stuff like this that explained why folks didn't think I was ADHD but did think my brother was, were helpful for the person that diagnosed me. I did this diagnosis through Kaiser that has a specific program to help with this diagnosis."

Because I don’t understand why your doc would straight up refuse to diagnose and treat d/t some alcohol consumption? Like if they are so concerned you can stop/lessen drinking? I’m confused by this lol..\n-Dr. google - seriously I get so upset when medical professionals blame the internet for “diagnosis shopping” sometimes you just want to know what fits your s/s… I’m a nurse and I still google everything, sorry not sorry. The internet can be validating, pick your sources wisely (that’s basically what is taught in research). \n-you can have both AUD and ADHD - in fact I’m pretty sure most of us have a spicy mix of both, but my main thing is that some of the debilitating symptoms of ADHD can be helped immensely with stimulants, etc… so why is your doc so hesitant to even TRY stimulants?\n\nI went through something similar, but I got diagnosed because I kept questioning the anxiety/depression… like how come I am devoid of feelings/completely numb when I take anxiety meds/antidepressants? Why does Wellbutrin help the executive function? Why am I unable to do things I like to do and want to do, but getting my brain to comply was like telling a 10 year old boy to  do his math homework on a Friday night?

I’ve questioned over the years if I was bipolar, autistic, OCD but nothing fit.  Then I started reading stories in some of these books and I finally felt validated because for the first time I read somethings that I felt I could’ve written.  I’ve always described my mind as like trying to drink from a firehose with distractions and free associations.

I found that the Wellbutrin helped my emotional regulation which helped improve my overall mood (tendency towards general impatience and irritability) but did nothing for my focus or motivation. I completed the monumental task for an ADHD’er (lol) of finding a new psych (ok I admit it was only once the old one stopped taking my insurance) and the new one had no problem starting me on a low dose of adderall. \n\nI think it can definitely be tricky to find the right doc and unfortunately the decreases executive function that comes with adhd makes it a challenge to keep doing the admin work to find them!

I had to fill out a questionnaire, have my wife fill it out as well, talked with the doctor for a bit, and she also recommended be getting any old report cards from my mom (which she had a bunch) so we could look and see if teachers had commented anything... \n\nI was a very highly gifted kid, but my report cards pointed out that I was constantly interrupting class, being loud, and often off task despite my test scores being amazing. No one thought I had ADHD, they just thought I was loud and lazy, but incredibly smart.\n\nIf your drinking however is enough to be a concern, and you have any form of addiction or dependency on alcohol or other substances, they will not provide you stimulants. That's a 100% given fact. Stimulants can be very addicting.  People with substance addiction have a high potential for abusing stimulants.  So they're not gonna take that risk, even if you don't think you're at risk of abusing it."

I wasn’t officially diagnosed with ADHD until I was 36. I didn’t even become aware of what ADHD looks like in girls/women until in my 30s and it was the “ohhhh” moment I’d spent nearly 20 years looking for. It wasn’t autism it was adhd that was different about me. Looking back there was clear signs as a young child but my parents just put it down to me being a ‘quirky’ kid. A late diagnosis definitely doesn’t mean it wasn’t always there. It would be like trying to say someone with stage 4 cancer doesn’t have cancer because it wasn’t diagnosed at the earliest stage.

Instead of writing up pages, you want to have multiple conversations - say “I read this (thing that’s like 5% of what you found) and I feel like it applies to me” and get their thoughts and just repeat that discussion with the next 5%. Don’t hide your perspective but also don’t explicitly try to convince them of it.

Having non-mainstream opinions rooted in research that hasn’t been caught up to by the big books is fine. But having non-mainstream opinions that have been overwhelmingly debunked by mainstream research for at least 13 years…..side eye.\n\nAlso it’s weird she wouldn’t diagnose you but was still willing to prescribe ADHD meds. This is purely speculation, but it sounds like it’s just her way of avoiding any pressure from you for stimulants. But not giving a patient the correct diagnosis as a way to mitigate her concerns about you being on stimulants is another unethical move to add to the list.\n\nHowever, I do think non-stimulants are an underrated option. My adhd is really severe and taking a low dose non-stimulant every day at a makes it so i only need a stimulant 1-3 times a week!\n\nAaannndd…to ease up a bit on your doc (still side eyeing though), while i *~hated~* her rationale…autism, depression, anxiety, and ADHD do have a lot of overlap in symptoms so teasing out a single or comorbid diagnosis can be trickier than it seems. Example - i often resonate with a lot of content on ASD even though i don’t have it because i share a lot of those experiences as someone with ADHD. But to validate the possibility of your suspicions with another example - I experience ebbs and flows of anxiety and depression throughout my life due to my ADHD. So you could be onto something. \n\nIf you want a real diagnosis, I think seeing a therapist routinely to help you address your symptoms for 3-6 months (or more if you like what you’re getting out of it) will result in a much more reliable diagnosis compared to a one-time comprehensive assessment or a psychiatrist that sees you every 2-6 months. Seeing how your symptoms manifest over a longer period of time could provide the insight needed to tease out the overlaps in criteria and nail down your diagnosis."

That's why the process exists. They see no difference between you telling them that their understanding of ADHD is archaic and their other patient's parent telling them they think the patient has autism because their ex got them vaccinated behind their back. A reprimand from your state licensing board will correct the behavior very quickly. I'd love to see a future where the psychiatric community is filled with professionals who have all at least heard of someone being reprimanded for this. That would be a true change in how this disorder is perceived. It could even affect public and law enforcement stigma.\n\nIf you do decide to report this to your state licensing board, focus on the unwillingness to test and the reasons given. Thinking autism is a better fit is a valid reason to not test. Doing well in school, not having been diagnosed in childhood, and flat out thinking that adult diagnosis is a made up Google thing are not valid reasons to not test and indicate a fundamental misunderstanding. Prior substance abuse is a valid reason to avoid prescribing stimulants, but not a valid reason to not test for the disorder. \n\nRegarding the suggestion to find a new doctor, absolutely. You are in the care of this person and it seems like they make you uncomfortable at the very least. I personally specifically requested someone that specializes in ADHD or at least has patients with adult diagnosed ADHD and it made a world of difference. It turns out she also has ADHD and used to work at the same hospital I did before I worked there. I dread the day that I may have to find a new doctor and that is the level of validation you should expect from your professionals. You should feel heard, not dismissed. \n\nI wish you the best of luck and I am sorry you've had a bad experience seeking treatment for what you are suffering from."

Lots of people love to say that they’re a little bit ADHD, but unless they have all of these bizarre quirks, and they get tested, they’re minimizing (usually with really knowing it) how exhausting, stressful and frustrating real ADHD can be. \n\nTime blindness, ADHD paralysis, weird food fixations, absolutely hating some foods, only wanting certain foods until I can’t stand the thought of it…sensory issues, always being tired, can’t focus, can’t stop focusing on something I shouldn’t be focusing on…and so much more!\n\nI say this a lot, but I’m always so thankful for communities like this, because I feel so much less alone.

    "comment": "I felt the same way. Good thing you had this talk with your psych to discover she’s not up to date on current ADHD information. As others have said, you need to find another and I highly recommend throwing some questions at them in the same vein to see how they respond. They should be up to date on the latest knowledge, for example knowing that ADHD IS diagnosed in adults and many populations are underrepresented, among other things. Just a few questions is enough to sus out whether their knowledge is out of date. If possible to ask on the phone before an appointment, you can save yourself some money. \n\nI also recommend going in with a list of symptoms and underneath each symptom write an honest and full account of every reason you have to believe you do or don’t experience that specific one. A psych (who understands ADHD) will want to know how it affects you in many ways so being able to list several different scenarios is very helpful. It’s also good to be honest about which symptoms you don’t think you have since ADHD presents differently for everyone. You may not use the list or only part of it, but it’s better to go in prepared. \n\nAt the end of the day, you are an expert in yourself and a psych is an expert in mental health diagnoses. You present your evidence with the understanding you don’t know if it meets the requirements for diagnosis, and the psych considers whatever it is they need to think about or administer tests for when it comes to diagnosing you."

When I was younger,  I had the \"forget to eat\" thing, then I would binge eat, then repeat. That was fine when my metabolism was 18 years old. As soon as I hit mid 30s, shock horror, I could no longer do that. I am still mad about it! Cut to age 45 and I am on a weight loss drug because my body simply will not shift weight even though I am super active. The drug, Mounjaro, has killed most of the 'food noise' and constant food seeking I did previously which is awesome. It is very expensive but I am happy with the results, even though it is extremely slow (some people have better luck). I still love food though, a lot! Finding a way to balance what I want with what my body needs. It's probably always going to be a struggle, and there is no shame in it! I am honestly so over this desire to be smaller/thinner.

It’s definitely worse when I don’t take my medication, but I’ve struggled with food my entire life.\n\nHit my mid-30s and looked into Binge Eating Disorder - which actually helped me about 70% of the way. I’ve spent my life obsessing over weight, losing it, getting depressed when I gain it back, and struggling to control my eating. BED therapy helped me take back control of that and I’ve been in recovery for 8 months now. It might not be the same for anyone else here but I thought I’d throw that out in case anyone is feeling in a hopeless cycle with restricting to “diet” and then getting to the evenings and bingeing.\n\nThe next thing that’s helped so far - I started Mounjaro. I’m still less than a week in, but oh my god the past 4 days have been heavenly. No cravings, very few thoughts about food at all. I feel like I actually have my concentration back and my meds work better.\n\nObviously speak to your doctor - an eating disorder and weight loss medication may not be a good idea for you. For me, it was pre-diabetes rearing its ugly head and being in a bad way health-wise from my weight that tipped the scales (hah) towards starting. Hoping to live a healthier, happier life without a food obsession from now 🤞🏼"

Its mainly shown through how many people in our community struggle with substance abuse and addiction. But it also applies to food.\n\nFood tastes good, i want to experience good, i eat food. It also ties in with impulsivity, you may be unable to stop thinking about food until it has been eaten, and you dont stop to think, 'oh, am i hungry right now?'. And we may not have to control to put it off until later. Cooking and eating food is also somewhat of an activity to cure boredom.\n\nAlso, just like how in school we were taught the non-ADHD way of studying and discipline, and it didnt work; weight loss is different for people with ADHD than those without. Non-ADHD ways of dieting dont necisarily apply because our brains are wired differently. But yeah, i get you."

You can go a long way and make a ton of different meals with things like rice, potatoes, onions, beans, canned/frozen veg, flour/ assorted baking goods etc. that last for a while in the pantry while stocking up on proteins when they're on sale and freezing them. It takes a little practice, but everything I make is tastier and healthier than all the take-out I used to gorge on. \n\nI usually grab a muffin at work and then just make one large meal that I can throw together in 30-45 minutes once I get back home. I find this pretty easy to maintain and this is from someone whose daily routine would be stop to grab a whole container of pastries to eat after work and then a few hours later I'd go out for fast food.

Idk what it was about that cake lmao, I've never done it since though, only for that like month long weird craving I had at the time haha. But I also did grow up really really poor and I do still have weird food insecurities, but like at the same time I honestly love any and all food and would eat at any time even if I'm full, if someone offered me food then I'm at least taking a bite lol. I no longer get to eat most foods now though cuz I can only have low fat foods cuz my gallbladder hates me. God even just typing this and thinking about food has me craving the garlic bread bites from dominoes. But also i gotta say that i actually am really happy with my weight, I'm 180lbs but I feel comfortable and confident in my body, so I'm happy being the weird food craving person I am 🫠\n Also wanna add that i didn't see where everyone started talking about wanting to loose weight, so I just don't want anything I said to be taken wrong at all either. I struggled both with being underweight and overweight. I finally just got my hormones leveled out and am at a weight I'm finally happy with. But also weirdly enough, having to eat low fat foods has helped me a lot, and yeah it's limiting at times, I can spend hours on Google and find soo many awesome recipes lol. I also look cooking because I like my food, so I get really excited when I find new recipes lol or I go down weird rabbit holes of recipes from like ancient times and shit.

In case of a, I lost like 20kg but I couldn't think of anything else than how little I could eat and how much I could exercise. I also had a massive crush on someone at work and seriously thought that they'd never like me if I'm fat. I was partially right but also very wrong as they're still by my side even after a roller coaster of weight losses and gains. \n\n In case of b, it was first hyperthyroidism, lost again about 15 kg in couple of months (and with hypo gained it all back and then some plus I was transferred to an office job and didn't do anything to lower my calories) and now I lost 12kg due to pregnancy, which unfortunately ended in miscarriage. It was insane to actually eat controlled portions with plenty of fruit and vegetables on what I would call auto drive (maybe intuitive eating would also be a good term). Now 6 ish weeks later I have already started to gain it back. I just can't eat the right things in the right amounts. It takes a lot of mental energy to eat the right things even though I have tried to lower the barrier by having things pre cut and not having any sweets around the house, because I will destroy them in a heart beat and consider a bag of sweets as a challenge to be conquered instead of a little treat here and there. It sucks. I hate being this size. I hate that I hate myself."

Most of these people actually eat nothing but fast food and highly processed snacks/frozen pizzas/frozen dinners/etc. Also near endless amounts of bread and carbs. All still skinny as hell.\n\nMeanwhile, I at least make an effort to eat well and eat home-cooked balanced meals (still having fast food somewhat regularly), I literally do not ever eat things like chips, Cheetos, crackers, doughnuts, fruit snacks, cookies, cupcakes, etc unless they're put in front of me at a work or personal party (which both happen extremely rarely). I NEVER buy these items with meals or when grocery shopping so they're never in my home to snack on. I almost never drink soda or juices or other sugary beverages. Yet here I am all of 5'8'' and 165lbs with a double chin and squishy as hell. Am I obese? No. Do I have thick thighs, jiggle a little when I walk, and have rolls and more curved bodily features for a man? Absolutely. \n\nLiterally the ONLY way I've been able to lose weight through diet alone (mind you none of the skinny ADHDers I know that eat pure garbage and stay skinny exercise) is when I was on basically a pure protein diet. Even trying to intentionally restrict calories but still eat a balanced diet I stay the same weight."

Also I learned that food plays a role in anxiety response.  \nBasically a lot of us learn subconsciously how to use food to calm ourselves because when we eat, our brain will tell the nervous system to calm down because we would never eat if we weren’t safe.  \nSo it can literally stop our fight/flight. When we eat, our brain says “oh wait, why are we scared because clearly we’re safe.”\nWhen you combine that with the dopamine hit, it gives us…it can cause a very vicious cycle.  Especially since we subconsciously learn that, as if we stumbled on it. We were scared or upset, then we ate and we started to feel better…and our brain was like perfect.

I have a bottomless stomach (like, can eat whole pizzas kind of bottomless) and always have, it's something I got from my dad, problem is I got my mother's weight retention so I'm always hungry but if I eat more than the bare minimum I gain weight.\n\nWhat helped me quite a bit was focusing on practicing delayed gratification. I'm very scheduled oriented because it helps keep me on track so I have scheduled times when I have lunch and dinner. If I'm hungry outside of those times and I see myself wanting to just grab a quick (likely unhealthy) snack, I instead force myself to stop and think about whether I *really* want another peanut butter sandwich or if I'm just being impulsive again. I remind myself that I'd rather wait and have something that's going to be a lot more substantial and satisfying (and probably healthier). To make things easier on low-executive days (read: most days) I got a rice cooker with a steam basket so I can put rice, veg, and meat all in at the same time, push a button, and 20 minutes later I'll have an easy, nutritious meal.

I've tried to wean off the Tirzepetide, but my binge eating comes back immediately. It's definitely better when I'm on Vyvance, but the moment that fades... e.g. in the evenings, it springs back. I'm so glad I understand my body better now (and that this is caused by my ADHD), but damn it's annoying. I can't even begin to imagine how different my life might have been had I known this for the last 30 years..."

    "comment": "The theory is that we are chemically wired to crave dopamine. There are many ways to get it, but food is one of them. Especially high-carb foods. Logic would then dictate that if your executive functioning is low and you are seeking dopamine, you’re likely to go to whatever source your brain has as “default.” It’s like starting a diet, but then going to a favorite restaurant and before you even realize what you said to the waitress, you’ve ordered “the usual.” Theoretically you could rewire this by consistently going to a different source for dopamine until your brain sees that as the default, but in practice our brains usually don’t behave as well as we want them to. I’ve managed to change my default to exercise a few times so that I craved a short run -desperately- but when the weather was too bad or I was injured, I had to pick something different, and food was the easiest choice. In my opinion it’s better to try and keep yourself from hitting that point with little relief points through the day, like a 5 minute walk or some good music, so that you don’t hit that mode."

But when I do eat it's at the wrong times and often the wrong things because I'm going for the sensory experience of eating instead of eating to fuel my body (sometimes because I have a fidget urge and drinks/vape aren't cutting it, sometimes I need something crunchy/salty/sweet/sour).

Also find a dish that is the equivalent of a serving and only ever let yourself use that for snacking. There are also plates with portion sizes marked out on them, some even physical dividers of the sections. Those are very helpful when she uses those.\n\nI myself am a sugar addict, so for me I have to be extra vigilant. If I buy myself a treat, I immediately break off what the serving size is, and I look at it for a while before I eat it and I decide which is the bite of it I want to end on and then make a game of putting off how long it takes me to get to that last bite. I also only let myself eat one at a time. It slows me down considerably, and that helps portion out the dopamine. So, yes, one M&M at a time, one square of a Hershey’s bar at a time, one jellybean at a time.\n\nSo if I get a bag of M&Ms, I pour them all out where I can see them, take one green one out and set it aside and then eat one M&M at a time and frequently look at the green one, knowing it is my last.

The only time I forget to eat is the rare times I find a new hobby that I am so hyperfocused on, but that doesn't last long at all, so I probably need to go see an eating disorder specialist ugh."

Living in New Mexico people always shock when I say I’m allergic to chili peppers. Anyways sugar and plain meat have always been my safe foods. Now that I’m an adult I basically live on meat. I am terrible about having a stash of sugary treats in my bedroom. My kids know about it and  help themselves. I also have PCOS which adds to my weight problem. I am 5 foot 2 inches tall and weigh about 175 pounds."

God forbid I buy a jar of peanut butter with the intention of just adding a spoon to oatmeal daily because it will be gone in days.\n\nThe only thing that managed to make a dent in it was intermittent fasting, because somehow having a hard rule of no eating at all during certain times is easier than trying to ration things through the whole day.\n\nI actually found it much easier to work out to improve my health instead of trying to keep a calorie deficit. I do feel better when I exercise and I look better in the end since muscle+fat aint a bad look either. People are surprised to know I weight 100kg because I don't look like 100kg, I'm more 'compressed' thanks to some muscle.\n\nI can keep up some good habits but some days the executive dysfunction is more of a bitch than other times like it has been the last few weeks :("

Over the years that lead from being severely underweight to being overweight (my guess is the binging stretches the stomach so over time it takes more to feel full or something).\n\nMeds that suppress my appetite make it worse.

As a teenager I would go eat a literal spoonful of sugar from the pantry because I just needed it. I've sucked on sugar cubes. Favorite cereal was cinnamon toast crunch and I'd eat it without milk so I could lick the sugar off. I am/have been a mess.\n\nYears of yo-yo dieting, but always fell off the wagon and mostly for sugar. Mmm, brownie a la mode...creme brulee, banana pudding...\n\nFinally started Wellbutrin a few years ago. That first year, we actually didn't finish off the leftover trick or treat candy within a year. First time in my life it wasn't gone in a month! I still have ups and downs, but overall I crave sugar less than I did. And since I started Strattera about a year ago, I've had a more stable lower sugar tooth. You mean it's possible to avoid eating dessert after dinner every night?

That way, if I'm hungry an hour after eating, I can just say \"That's ok, I only ate something small and now I can eat something else.\"  When I'm able to \"stay on the wagon\" it works super well, unfortunately that's definitely the part that ADHD affects the most.\n\nI also have a ton of different workout equipment at home so that no matter what kind of mood I'm in I can find something that appeals to me to do after work, but once I miss a day it's so hard to get myself into the rhythm again."

I did lose a bunch of weight the first year on vyvanse by leaning into it and doing intermittent fasting but I had to stop because it turns out starving yourself all day is not great for you either so I gained back pretty much all the weight. Learning intuitive eating, practicing body/self acceptance/compassion, and adding more movement to my daily life like taking the stairs whenever I have the choice especially at work. More work altogether but I think I’m happier now and more likely to maintain any weight loss I can achieve. Anyway, good luck, friend!\n\nEdit: didn’t -> did"

Not eating cos you can’t manage to organize buying it cooking food, or because of a response to stimulants or because of hyper-focus on other things, or hyperactivity connected with high metabolism.\n\nOn the flip side it can mean sitting around doing nothing cos you can’t figure out what the next step is, and sometimes the easiest next step in front of your nose is what you do.  Hmm. There’s a cookie. Eat it.  \n\nLikewise sugar is a stimulant so sugary foods could be a constant attempt to trigger your brain into action. I’ve never understood the sugar=energy link, as i don’t get sugar rushes or sugar highs, but your body may be looking for that constantly even if it’s not succeeding. \n\nYou may need strategies around food that help limit bored or impulsive eating.  For example do not have snack foods in the house, shop with basic ingredients so you have to cook your meals (dry goods, veggies, Fruits, etc)"

    "comment": "This is so relatable to me. I have been an overweight overeater since childhood. I had trauma and food insecurities as a child due to my parents being young, traumatized addicts. I didn't know how food and weight worked as a kid, I used it to soothe and dissociate. Growing up in the 90s and early 2000s it was not average for kids to be chunky. We were few and far between and stuck out like sore thumbs. Add c-ptsd, undiagnosed adhd (female), and rsd then you have a recipe for binge/restrict shame spirals feeling like I'm not worthy of love unless I look like the girls on MTV. \n\n\nI have lost almost 100lbs and gained it back 3 times since 2016. I would hyperfixate, gamify, obsess over it and then I would burn myself out that I never entered into a maintenance. I never felt I had lost enough even though I had. So when the weight stopped going down, the dopamine well would dry up. Then back to the salt, sugar, fat mine in search of dopamine. \n\n\n2016- 45 day juice fast (down 90 lbs)\n2018- High carb low fat vegan (down 80 lbs)\n2020- Macro ratios, weighing and tracking EVERYTHING on chronometer, 15,000 steps a day and weight lifting, weighing in every morning with weekly progress photos (down 90 lbs)\n\n\nThe last time I didn't get down to my 140 goal weight (5'7\") so I never went into maintenance. I look back on my progress photos and can see that at my lowest I needed to up my carbs and calories and focus on building and maintaining the muscle mass that I had built. I was in a good place, but I couldn't see it. By 2023 I was back up to 250. Now I have my diagnoses and medicated. Only down 10 lbs since october 2024. \n\n\nThere is a constant battle in my head between \"let's go crazy diet tournament win win win!\" and \"give me that hit of salty sweet heroin\". I can't pretend that vanity and self esteem is not a massive factor. I am gorgeous when I'm not fat. The leo in me loves it. Especially since I never felt beautiful as a child and teen. I do have a man who has been there since 2011, a 9 year old daughter together. He's always told me I am beautiful and supports me wherever I am. If I want to throw out all the junk and live on juice, he's outside growing kale. If I want to get my tubby on, he's out to pick up the beer and pizza. I don't get judgment only compassion.  It's my journey to travel and he's here for the ride."

The 14 weeks course incorporated CBT and a bit of talking therapy, covering food journaling (specifially not calorie counting), regular planned eating (3 meals and 3 snacks spread throughout the day - this \\*massively\\* helped me), weekly weighing to get over scales anxiety, but no more, no less than once per week so as to not obsess or avoid, etc.\n\nSome of the things that aren't in the book:  \n\\* Speaking to each other in group about our eating patterns, when we felt a lot of guilt and shame, mirrored by each other - it was helpful knowing we weren't alone and everyone felt very similar  \n\\* Standing in front of a mirror to get over the anxiety spikes - evaluating our bodies in an objective way, so changing \"my arms are flabby\" to \"my arms are strong and let me carry things\"  \n\\* Once a week we'd read our food journals out and evaluate what we'd done well, where we could make improvements (one person per week, sessions were only 90 mins for 5 of us)  \n\\* The \"Real Food Pyramid\" - a chart that shows the types of foods (and rough amounts) of what we should be trying to keep in our diet  \n\\* Unhelpful Thinking Styles - black and white thinking (I've messed up my diet today so might as well just quit), catastrophising (if I gain weight nobody will love me again), labelling (I'm weak/have no willpower because I can't stop myself eating food)  \n\\* Generally having the accountability is helpful\n\nI'm happy to share the resources I was given if needed, but I think if you can find a therapist who is trained in eating disorders and hopefully also ADHD it would be better than a stranger on the internet :)"

    "comment": "Yeah trying to get prescriptions is wild right now anyway, if insurance won't cover it that's a whole other thing. I've been splitting doses to save some cash - since I have worse side effects at my 5mg tirzepatide, I use sterile vials, insulin-sized syringes and bacteriostatic water to inject the pen into a vial and only draw 2.5mg doses out, refrigerating the vial til next time. That way I'm basically only paying half price for my meds. Found a guide to doing it on reddit somewhere. Only works if you can tolerate cutting down the prescription size, though. \n \nI hope things get better for you. Genuinely wish I had better advice, but I was just as stuck before this so I have no idea how else to make it better. It was literally an addiction to food and I'm honestly shocked even this stopped it. The appetite suppressant was enough to just kind of make me forget to obsess about it."

It wasn't as bad on lower doses and usually takes a couple shots to really kick on, so splitting doses and taking breaks between full ones has helped. I also have R-CPD which means gas gets trapped with absolutely no way out (leading to extreme pain and vomiting), but I'm working on getting that treated to at least mitigate the problem. It sucked so bad for a while there, my mood was overall worse, depressed, kind of felt like I finally had hope and it was evaporating in front of me. But dose splitting and taking longer breaks between shots has helped, so I'm still trying. The pain is very much Not Cool though."

I don't inherently know what's good or bad as far as weight in kg (though naturally, I can presume I weigh too much because I can see how I look), so what I get out of this is trends. I don't weigh myself on a schedule and rather just check in periodically. I don't even have a goal weight in kg, though I do have one in lbs. I get my real weight when I go to the doctor.\n\nI'm not sure if that might help anyone else, and doubly not sure if this trick will help people who use the metric scale for weight (your US Customary weight will be a much larger number, and that might be triggering)."

I actually think all the workbook and worksheets stuff is close to what the book informs on as well, but the book goes into a bit more detail about the psychology of eating disorders etc so if it's an affordable option for you, I'd definitely recommend it.\n\nWe were also given a couple of work sheets from [https://www.psychologytools.com/](https://www.psychologytools.com/) although I'm not certain where the ones we got are located as there doesn't seem to be anything specific to BED listed for the public.\n\nI hope any of this helps!"

    "comment": "Absolutely. I was angry for a long time. People told my mom they thought I was “hyperactive”, as they said in the ‘70s, but she saw my hyper-focus and didn’t think it was true. I was officially diagnosed at 35.\n\nBut here’s the thing - back in our parents time mental health wasn’t discussed because it came with the very real fear of being institutionalized. There are generations of people trying to make their kids “act normal” so they wouldn’t get taken away. If you could fake it, you did. And if you have ADHD, the chances of one of your parents also having it is very high. They likely have years of trauma of being told to “be normal” and act like nothing’s wrong, so that fear got passed down to you. \n\nI understand your anger, but they also deserve your pity. They honestly didn’t know. And they especially didn’t know that we can actually get help now instead of just locking away the non-typical. Enjoy your new found freedom, mourn for the child-you who got no help and no understanding, and pity the elders in your life who will never know that they no longer have to work so hard to hide who they are because there is help available now."

When I was 19, I found a new group of friends who had ADHD. I found a lot of comfort being around them. Like a calm chaos. At 25, I had two back to back concussions then went to university. I was told that I couldn't be appropriately diagnoses with ADHD because my concussion would muck up the adhd exam. At 35, I had my maternal psychologist submit paperwork to our provinces mood disorder clinic to get me into accelerated testing because my symptoms exploded post partum. The declined to see me. \n\nMy family physician just finished additional testing to help with ADHD diagnostics and treatment. During my daughters 18M checkup, I briefly mentioned it. She scheduled me in the next week, diagnosed me and started me on meds. My entire world has changed. I can pay attention, my house is clean, my focus is purposeful.\n\nAnd I can't help but wonder if my life would have been different if someone would have listened to me. Helped me advocate. \n\nI'm happy where I am in life and love where my journey has taken me.

I always assumed its when kids are very energetic, and in my circle it was more of an insult, or description to say someone is hyperactive.. \n\nWhen I went to Uni, I was beating myself up mentally every day, I wanted to perform well, so I would sit in the library for hours, trying to start my coursework, whilst sitting in front of an empty word document, unable to get started despite really wanting to... \n\nI would write 2 sentences, and change them 6 times over an hour, whilst my classmates wrote a couple paragraphs... \n\nI have only graduated thanks to making really good friends at Uni, who saw me struggling and helped me write up my coursework, and held me accountable to do the work.. \n\nAfter graduation, I wanted to apply to placements, graduate programs etc, but I just could not do it... it was so overwhelming, so whilst my friends went on to start their career, i was depressed in my bed, until I ran out of savings, and got a minimal wage job as a social worker to pay the bills.. \n\nAfter 2 years, i got a managerial position at a different company, it was chaotic, which I loved, but when the job moved to WFH due to covid, I couldn't do the work, god knows I tried, but I couldn't....\n\nIve quit, depressed again, everything i tried in life failed at this point, all the hobbies, projects, and jobs... \n\nI saw a therapist, got some advice on setting boundaries, but it wasn't that helpful.\n\nI've committed to losing weight, managed to lose a fair chunk, made some acquaintances, and agreed to go on a holiday with them....\n\nDuring our stay, I realised I was quite impulsive during conversations, and realised that I would loose track of what others were saying, my mind would disconnect, and when I was explaining things, I would speak really fast, and not stay on topic... \n\nWell, after that unpleasant experience, I started googling if it's normal to keep forgetting things, being unable to focus on reading books or conversations and found the term ADHD. \n\nThanks to posts like yours, I started reading up on it, and one evening I was in tears as every article and post ive read resonated with my experience, and it was obvious i jad ADHD....\n\nYour idea of replacing an old tv with a hd one is spot on, thats how i feel too, but I think its crucial to start and reinvent old beliefs amd limitations...\n\nMy parents always discourage me when i start a new project or hobby, as in the past ive started doze s which I never finished or completed, but i tell myself that now things might be different, amd try it anyway... \n\nI think noticing is one thing, but our parents have been raised with this stigma around mental health. \nThe old \"you cant be depressed, look at all the options you have\" or I'll give you something to be sad about mentality....\n\nEven when I told my mother I have adhd, she never followed up, just said, \"oh, everyone forgets things, and has down days from time to time\".... dismissing me...\n\nI'm glad I'm medicated now, I would love for my dad to try medication too, as I think he's got ADHD too, but I think the idea of having a mental disorder might be too big of an insult to him, and he would stright up.decline the thougt... \n\nFunny thing is, about 2 months ago, he found a tik tok, about ADHD and forgetfulness , and he jokingly showed me and said, look, guess we got ADHD.... and laughed... I might tell him one day, about my diagnosis but I think he's going to deny it, or tell me I'm being ripped off for medication by the system or whatever..."

I spent 3 years on ritalin then quit it.  about 4 months ago I realized I was failing at \"just white-knuckling through life\" so now I'm on different similar stuff and we're dialing it in.\n\nHere's the thing:  Yes.  I get EVERY bit of that, from before I was medicated to the near 30 years I spent away from it.\n\nWhile I can't take back the past.  My parents are long gone and couldn't have seen what they couldn't see (they tried, but it was as if nobody had ever heard of it before.  No testing, no evaluation.  I was just \"a problem.\")\n\nBut what you're going to find out is this:  You've been running like a car in 2nd gear at 80. Now, with the medication, the amount of WORK it takes just to stay between the lines and stay straight is going to drop tremendously.  \n\nHere's the thing:  ALL that mental energy?  All that effort to focus?  Your brain has been doing \"leg day\" every day for almost 40 years.  YOU GET THAT MENTAL CAPACITY BACK!  You've been training hard mode your whole life.\n\nYes.  It's easy and perfectly justifiable to be angry and frustrated at \"time lost.\"  And YES, you're going to have to spend a lot of time and effort unraveling trauma, trying to figure out if it's related to this or not (ask me how I know.)\n\nBut once the dust settles from this explosive insight, you're going to find yourself able to accomplish amazing things.\n\nIf you'd started medication at...what...8?  10 years old?  You'd have had a smoother childhood, sure.  (And of course, who's to say if that \"would have been better\"?)\n\nBut...you would never have learned SO many of the things you've learned.\n\nDon't pretend to be happy when you're not.  But be aware of the temptation to indulge in victimhood as well. (Not that you are.  It's just something to be aware of.)\n\nYou've got an amazing journey ahead of you."

My diagnosis was a gift to me.\n\nFinding out that I'm not the only person like this was probably the biggest surprise though. I had likely met many people struggling exactly as I was throughout my life, but I was blind to the possibility because, surely, this peculiar, inexplicable suffering was unique to me?\n\nUntil I was 47, I didn't have any real idea what (inattentive) ADHD was. Neither did anyone else in my family; or my teachers in New Zealand in the 1970s; or in Australia when we moved here in the 80s. Should I now be angry with people who were as ignorant as I was about ADHD, for not understanding something that was going on inside my brain, that they knew nothing about?  No. Really, there is no one to blame, and being bitter just wastes more precious time.\n\nLife has often been difficult, and hasn't gone the way I expected - or at least the way I thought I wanted it to - in many ways. But think the really important things have worked out pretty well so far. Career and money? Not really. Relationships, love and family? Yes.\n\nSo, I'm grateful - even though it took 47 years - because I could just as easily still not know."

Angry that I could sometimes be the very best in a given scenario, and other times barely able to drag myself out of bed. I don’t blame my parents for not picking up on it because both of them have conditions of their own and grew up in a different era. But I got my diagnosis 4 years ago, here’s my experience:\n\nBeing diagnosed in my mid 30s was more freeing than anything else. I was finally able to let go of the ideal version of myself I’d built up over the years but was never able to fully live up to. When I realized my highest achieving moments were from hyper-focus and the ensuing burn out wasn’t from a lack of resolve or self discipline, it was such a relief. Sure, I still wish I could be that guy all the time but I’m perfectly happy now to be sometimes exceptional, sometimes subpar, but rarely ordinary.

So much was unknown, my hyperactive (for a 7 year old boy) cousin was given meds and it completely changed his happy personality into closed off, sit in the corner and never speak to anyone or eat. My parents always thought something was off about that. He wasn't happy, it wasn't healthy. They felt like maybe the medical world needed more time to be more accurate. \n\nWe were lucky, although my siblings and I went undiagnosed (we had no blatantly obvious traits so I don't blame my parents at all), my parents adjusted the way we approached the world. They recognized that we needed something different than other kids. My mom started homeschooling us when the teachers got mad that my brother was too far ahead of the class and did not provide any challenging work for him. \n\nWe went to museums, learned about things we had interests in, and my mom made sure we still socialized in the neighborhoods we lived in. We participated in volunteer opportunities in the community and at church.\n\nWe didn't have much, but my parents were instrumental in all of our successful lives by teaching us skills to adapt our adhd and funnel it into productivity. Looking back, I believe both of my parents had adhd as well. But for their generation there wasn't anything to do but live and adapt.\n\nI believe that acknowledging mental health concerns in general has come a long way since I was a kid in the 80's and 90's. I try to remember that my life may have been more \"normal\" if we had been diagnosed as children, but I would not be the person I am today.

I felt like two different therapists were just reading a script. I finally got someone to listen to me, and she diagnosed me with Combined type ADHD, and said I'm really good at masking. \n\nI think because I had a lot of traumatizing experiences as a kid, and I had to learn to depend on myself, no one ever noticed any of the indicators. Add to that being a female, because girls weren't supposed to have this, right?\n\nETA that I'm still trying to find the right meds. It's been such a struggle, because I've got other conditions that make medication tricky.

Most people I talk to don't know that it's a neurodevelopmental disorder even. \n\nI still sometimes feel a little angry over the missed time, but ultimately I just try to take satisfaction in all the progress I've made since then, and the fact that I have some idea how to pilot my brain now."

I can relate to the negativity being poured on by parents and other figures who don't see ADHD as a possibility. I'm the same age and didn't get diagnosed until 25, shortly before losing my job and health insurance with it. It took me a while to get treatment with any consistency, and right I'm back to trying to manage without medication because my budget is constrained. With or without medication, the routines, checklists, alarms, physical activity, and all those other tools and tactics we use never stop being important."

Im fairly certain my dad has AuDHD, too. He used to say adhd is just an excuse for lazy people to be lazy. And he's got so many social and anxious behaviors that just scream it. He thinks he is a very suave and extroverted guy, but he's not. He can be a great connector and tell stories, but it's like a good salesman who goes home and then hides when his kids have friends over. He tries to cut networking events short bc they're loud and make him feel bad. Idk i could go on and on, but ill stop here.

    "comment": "OP, first I want to say that you are not alone. Like others who have commented here, I was diagnosed later in life (late 30’s). It was missed in me as a child as well. I believe that at the time, only hyperactivity was noticed or diagnosed. I was inattentive as well. I was intelligent and did well in school— primarily from high test scores. I always hated doing homework and reading. I struggled in college but eventually got past it. Finished my master’s degree at 37. \n\nSecond, I know firsthand how frustrating this is, but I’m not mad at anyone. My parents didn’t know any better. They knew that I didn’t pay much attention to things, but dismissed it as being bored out not being challenged enough. They were kind of right, but giving me more challenging things that didn’t interest me only made things worse. The school didn’t care because I wasn’t disruptive. So I, like you, fell through the cracks. \n\nI struggled with jobs as well. I had previously worked in retail, which for the most part worked well with my undiagnosed ADHD. It was a lot of running around and handling different stuff all day. When I started in an office job, I (in hindsight) hyperfocused to learn the job and be successful. When I first started working from home it really became obvious that something was wrong. Trying to get my work done was like trying do drive a car with a passenger who keeps yanking the steering wheel. It took all my energy just to keep the car from crashing, so to speak. Never mind getting to my “destination”.\n\nAnyways, it’s been a journey, and it’s been enlightening. I’ve learned a lot about myself and the psychology of motivation. I’ve tried to help others as well. I’ve also had to try a lot of different medications and other life hacks to be more successful in life. I found a career and employer that I really enjoy. I have tons of autonomy and variety in my work. \n\nNow that you know what has been behind your issues all these years, you are finally back in control. Your journey is just getting started."

All this to say, if you'd gotten diagnosed as a kid like me, it might not have helped much, because it didn't help me much. I dropped out of high school and a few colleges.

Too late to go back to school for a high paying career so i feel like i'm on a crappy rollercoaster and just have to wait it out now.\n\nAs a kid I was smart. I was smarter than all of the kids in my elementary school and my parents encouraged me to compete because if i wasn't the best, i was nothing. So, stressed but competitive, i kept at it, hard, and was doing great. They never thought to look at why i was 'lazy'.. what caused me to not want to do any of the long-term projects, or be able to get my shit together until the last moment.\n\nIn high school i started to slip and then when my parents were no longer hounding me I went from top of the class to middling pretty damn quick.\n\nIn university, since i never had to study more than cursory amounts in elementary and HS i was truly under water for a couple of years, failing first year calculus twice until i got special permission from the dean to take it again. Once I got past the first two years of classes, where you have to take a bunch of shit you don't want, I started to really excel again and my upper division GPA is a far cry from my CGPA, but of course the CGPA is what gets you into post-grad, so i was fucked permanently by that.\n\nI became an accountant after getting my biology degree because i hated labwork and back home it was paying like $20K a year (Canadian dollars, 2001 era, and  yes those are poverty wages).  Accounting is easy for me for the most part, except when i make mistakes because i got too wrapped up in something to bother double checking my work.\n\nNow that i'm medicated i'm doing better at my career for the most part - i no longer feel overwhelmed. I still get the majority of my work done in the late hours like you but for different reasons. In the daytime there's people yelling and joking in the office and it's like a circus and i have to listen in case i'm being dragged into something or someone is going to prank me or whatever so i'm constantly kind of alert to the room and not working well.  I have some really inconsiderate coworkers, like another ADHD person who is attention starved who will just start talking loudly to the room and if you accidentally make eye contact she'll drag you into her bullshit.\n\nAt 3PM when everyone but me and my boss fucks off suddenly the productivity goes up - who woulda figured.\n\nI'd work from home but my computer desk there is absolutely atrocious and though i keep meaning to replace it i never get around to it. So the tray makes horrible creaking noises while i'm typing and it distracts me too ...\n\nBut.. can i fault my parents? no. This was the 1990s and innattentive ADHD was only ever diagnosed in the kids who truly absolutely couldnt' pay attention and weren't gifted like me. \n\nI wish i could go back in time and tell them about it and get me treatment because i really wanted to be an electronics engineer, but the 22 credit hours/semester workload would've destroyed normal unmedicated me."

I went off to college and bombed immediately lol very active and interested in class but I just couldn’t do the coursework and projects etc. bad time mgmt, prioritizing tasks, you know the drill. \n\nI deal with being irritated with them and my family at times because they knew. And at no point did anyone tell me “hey. You’ve got this condition that can make your life difficult and if you don’t take precaution over these things, your life will get worse.” My mom set up the things I needed to be successful as someone with ADHD but I had no idea why they were there and I feel like I’ve blown my entire 20s fucking up because of my ignorance. I’m not good at managing it now but I’m good at noticing when it’s fucking everything up so I can kinda work around it.

In all likelihood, the vast majority of adults in your world when you were growing up either had no real idea what ADHD was or didn't know what signs to look for.  It's unfortunate, but the good thing is that now society is much more aware and much more receptive to neurological disorders.  Obviously not everybody is keen on the social sciences, but enough of the population is knowledgeable that hopefully fewer and fewer people will be left behind.\n\nThe first couple weeks after my diagnosis I was very resentful of having not gotten a proper diagnosis cause I had been seeing therapists since the age of 17, because I started having severe anxiety at 14 and deep depressive episodes by 16.  None of my therapists ever helped until I got a proper diagnosis. However, I eventually acknowledged that it was the ignorance of the population that prevented an early diagnosis.  Since there's nothing that can be done about the past, we can use our personal experiences and all the new things we learn about our disability to inform and thus enrich those around us.\n\nHope that's not coming off as some sort of saccharine platitude, I genuinely mean it.  I'm in the process of researching to write a book about my family and the consequences of war, stress and environmental exposures on inter-generational developmental disorders.  I don't care what my legacy is other than I want it to help others, especially kids and adults that have to navigate a modern life that's not well suited for our disorder."

I could never understand why the downs seemed to coincide with times when I should have been ‘contented’. \n\nLike you, as far as career goes, I’m out of time. Doing pretty much the same job as I was 20 years ago, my erratic personality stopped me breaking into c-level positions. But outside work - I’m happier than ever. I’ve discovered past-times and friendships that would never have been possible during my roller-coaster years. I’m learning to be ‘contented’ instead of chasing a high of some kind. \n\nNot many people get the opportunity to have a fresh outlook at 50. My main sadness is that my poor undiagnosed father, who’s rollercoaster was even more extreme - never had that opportunity before he died. \n\nLike him, I wasn’t a great father - but I can make up for it now. Maybe not financially - but some things are more important. Even in this f’ked up materialistic world. \n\nI still have moments of sadness at what I’ve lost and self-hatred for under-achieving. But as my dad used to say, it doesn’t matter where you’ve been - it’s where you are that counts."

Please consider this.\nWhen you were a child, born with ADHD, you developed coping mechanisms as you found your way from Highschool to young Adult. Once faced with the world, you adjusted to it as it slowly opened up to you.\nAt some point, something happened.\n For me, it was when I had to give up a job that gave me identity and purpose with great benefits and a pension. It happened because I was in the hospital and was given a shot of demerol into my piriformis muscle instead of my fatty hip. \nI was introduced to Chronic Pain soon after. Loss of Identity and Depression followed. I took classes at the local college, worked part time for a friend, while raising my (step) daughter and my son as a single parent. \nNo one ever mentioned executive dysfunction or ADHD. I masked so well in public, but knew something wasn't right. I saw Psychologists over and over, but I can do anything for 45 mins, right? \nA time will come, after you find out the quirks of us ADHD/ED folks, you'll find the majority of women were not diagnosed until recently, like just the past 7 years.

As a small child teachers recommended I be tested for “hyperactivity”; the doctor’s test was asking me to sit on a chair. I did that so I couldn’t be hyperactive 🤦🏼‍♂️\n\nAnd that’s the problem — lack of understanding of ADHD, what it really is and what it looks like — when we were young (I’m 5 years older than you). It’s only just starting to be sufficiently understood by doctors and the general public, and there’s still a way to go. \n\nWhich leaves us with anger, but no one to focus it on. We can’t really blame people for not spotting something they didn’t know about. That can make it hard to resolve. Along with the grief for who we could have been and what we could have achieved if we’d been diagnosed earlier, which many people experience and is probably somewhat unavoidable. \n\nIt’s natural to feel anger and grief, and I think the best approach is to focus on the future and let it pass naturally rather than focus on it. Try to remind yourself it wasn’t anyone’s fault they missed it, and focus on the benefits of being diagnosed now and in the future. You can finally do things more easily, and you can learn about your brain works differently and learn to work with it to get what you want out of life. That’s an amazing thing to have, even if it came late. It could easily have not come at all. \n\nThat’s not meant to sound scolding or preachy, or like it minimises your feelings - they’re of course valid and very common, and I’ve had them too (still do sometimes).

    "comment": "I will say that, especially as a new parent, I can understand extreme reluctance. In the past there was so much going around about ADD being over-diagnosed, and normal kids were being drugged by their parents to make them easier to deal with. If you do not have it, ADD can be a really difficult thing to grasp. This sort of thing: \"Of course you have a hard time focusing on tasks some times, everyone does! Everyone daydreams at some point. Every kid would rather be playing then doing homework.\" Etc.\n\nEvery parent goes through the stages of a kid's life where they cannot focus on anything for very long (that's being a toddler), and it is maybe difficult to know where it is no longer something that you are helping them grow out of, and when it is their brain chemistry making things much, much more difficult for them than the average kid. Giving your child this brain-altering medication that appears to almost sap their energy and alters their personality... is scary.\n\nI don't know if this resonates with you, but it is something I think about a lot on this subject. I was diagnosed and treated fairly early on, but my mom did delay it a year or two beyond when it was recommended, and the delay left me in an awkward situation after moving to a new school where I was this annoying, hyperactive, unfocused kid who did not fit into any of the cliques. It was a difficult start that stuck with me for the next few years. But, I can appreciate that my mom was really just trying to do her best.\n\nI was lucky to have been diagnosed, of course. And in the grand scheme of things, I really can't complain at all. But even that several year rough period from a delay decades ago still sticks around in my head, and I can see ways that it has changed who I am today."

    "comment": "Ok first, tangentially, it’s unlikely that you’re feeling the benefit from Strattera beyond placebo in two weeks. If you are, congratulations on you and your psychiatrist hitting a hole in one, pharmacologically speaking. I know I’m an asshole for starting here, please forgive me. And seriously, finding the right med can take years, or may never happen, so truly, congratulations. \n\nBut now, more to your point, I completely empathize. You will likely find that part of your process is grieving all the lost time when you weren’t getting treatment for your unrecognized ADHD. That’s certainly been my experience. I was raised by a special education teacher and a psychologist, neither of whom even remotely considered me having ADHD, despite years of my child self saying “something isn’t right here, emotionally,” and plenty of report cards with comments like “gifted but doesn’t apply self,” or (my favorite) “hinders the learning of others.” I’m so pissed that my teachers and parents felt that these conclusions were the end of the story, instead of some fucking curiosity about WHY it was that I wasn’t “applying” myself. What was lacking, both from my knowledgeable parents and teachers, was “attunement” to my experience. Eventually, I came to see myself this way- intelligent, but not diligent, and I definitely made career decisions informed by that story of myself. \n\nIronically, I was diagnosed at 27 after my father died, and I was deep in grief. ADHD was the last thing on my mind, but the diagnosis put everything into the right frame. I still didn’t find the right treatment until 39 (Dexedrine ftw), and even then, it’s still a struggle. Every time I set a goal for myself, I have o claw through the rubble of 4 decades of not following through on my own ambitions to think it’s even possible. Thank goodness for the armor of eternal ADHD optimism. \n\nSo, yes, OP, I relate, and you have every right to be angry. You may always be angry, and that’s ok. My hope for you is that over time, you choose to “reparent” yourself and give your inner child the kind of self-attunement that you have found lacking from the world for 39 years."

Living in any fear-like state as a child is incredibly harmful. It can easily lead to feelings of unworthiness which would have undoubtedly been compounded when ur ADHD symptoms caused u to struggle. I think that is a deeper topic and perhaps you have already worked thru that trauma so I’ll try to re-focus back to ur question now.\n\nI think feeling and admitting you are feeling angry is a GOOD thing. Writing down your feelings can really assist u in terms of processing how ur feeling… and allow u to make sense of why ur feeling this way… AND why your feelings are VALID. \n\nBeing angry now doesn’t mean you will always feel angry. Feelings change and evolve. You are realizing something and seeing a situation from ur childhood from a completely new perspective. So, ya… u didn’t know this info before and now u do.\n\nIt effing sucks that no one put forth the effort necessary for u to be diagnosed as a child.

I only got treatment because I thought I had ADHD and while it did not appear to impact my school performance as a young kid, once I got to high school and started taking more standardized tests it became much more apparent. I was not failing, but I knew I should have been doing better than I was. I was already seeing a psychiatrist for anxiety and depression so it was easy to get diagnosed and treated. \n\nBefore my ADHD diagnosis I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder. \n\nI think those are both wrong and I actually have ADHD and PMDD (the latter of which was not diagnosed officially because I already had the MDD diagnosis). Most issues are now better controlled with birth control and ADHD medication than they ever were with SSRIs alone. I still experience what appears to be social anxiety but I think it is actually RSD and emotional disregulation. ADHD meds help but it's still there. \n\nEven by 16, I had already developed multiple very poor coping strategies that were putting my health/life at serious risk that took me a lot of therapy to mostly deal with and I will always wonder if that still would have happened if someone had noticed something was up when I was 7."

It lead to major hyper independence but also meant I didn’t get diagnosed with ADHD till I was 23/24. \n\nEvery time I struggled it just made me look like I was acting out and because of that I ended up masking my symptoms well into adulthood until I was so burnt out and depressed I couldn’t take it anymore. \n\nIt sucked. But I’m proud of how much I fought to get here. It could have been easier but it wasn’t and that’s just the way it happened. \n\nUnfortunately we don’t always get the understanding we needed as children but we can as adults.

She refused because she “didn’t want me to have a label I could use as an excuse to get out of trying.”\n\nNow, this could be a polarizing opinion. Was I a little annoyed when I finally got diagnosed in my thirties? Yep. But do I also somewhat agree with my mum’s decision? In some ways, I can see the rationale behind it. She knew I was smart, and she knew I would not put any effort into anything I found boring. She knew I had to be sufficiently stimulated. And I ended up doing fairly well in school. \n\nBut as I got older, certain symptoms of a condition I didn’t know I had began having a larger negative impact on my life. I thought I was going crazy. I thought I was a failure. Everything seemed harder for me than it was for everyone else. I changed my career at least 3 times in 6 years. That finally lead to my diagnosis, which was a massive, eye-opening relief. I finally understand the way my brain works, and how, and how to work *with* that instead of against it. I’ve held my current job for 10 years now. \n\nThere were other ways my mum could’ve gone about using the information my teachers gave her when I was in grade 3. But it’s okay because I now jokingly blame her for everything. After my diagnosis, I realized she has ADHD, too. And she has it even worse than me. She is now on the waitlist for assessment herself. So I blame her for the genetics. And when I failed to check the oil in my car, an older vehicle whose engine consumes it, until it was *almost* too late, I told my mum the story and said “well, I have ADHD and I *am* using it as an excuse. ;)” We still get along."

I was a girl though and very smart so no one really suggested I get evaluated. Once I went to middle school and got more homework and was on my own more my grades dropped significantly. So I was hyper and disruptive and doing bad in school so I was labeled as a ‘bad kid’ and my parents were constantly upset at me and yelling at me.

It's that last part I want to talk about. I, to my knowledge, never took medications for ADHD. I might have, but I don't remember a time in my life as how you describe the last part.\n\nSomething I do know about, though, is anxiety. I've been able to classify my anxiety as I feel different types. I don't know if this is a normal thing we do as humans, ADHD-ers or it's just me. Genuinely speaking, I've always wondered. I have the deep in the chest anxiety when I'm feeling sad or lonely. I have the craving anxiety which I feel numbing my mind and fingertips until I cave. I have the overindulgent anxiety which is this weird doubling down feeling I get in my stomach if I don't \"smoke enough\" or eat more. If I listen to this anxiety, I end up overindulging in things that would otherwise not be harmful. I've never met anyone in my entire life with worse anxiety than mine, it just never goes away and stays on my chest (the one I feel all day) and drives me crazy. Maybe I'm wrong and I'm feeling what you guys feel, giving it my own nomenclature, I don't know.\n\nI really fucking want to know."

Being alive and feeling with a more stable brain (medicated since 1 year) is life changing. \n\nThe truth is it's in the past. Also, the circumstances were different when we were children.

We're learning a lot more about adult ADHD now.\n\nI think it's natural to have a grief response when diagnosed. Although it does explain much about why we are the way we are, it can also bring on feelings of \"if I had known this when I was younger, my life would have been easier\". I'm dealing with that as well. Many helpful online forums can give you a chance to vent.\n\nDon't think that you're the only one. There are lots of us in the same boat. Good luck!"

I just got my diagnosis at 32 a few weeks ago: I am still waiting to get into my primary care doctor to talk medication and therapy, since I was diagnosed by a psychologist not a psychiatrist. I’ve struggled my entire life like you. Our stories sound very similar. My entire life my parents always called me lazy because school was so hard for me. Even in elementary school I rarely got over a C for a grade. Instead of trying to help me it was always just a blame game for them. It was always my fault even being so young. They still to this day say I was just lazy and sneaky, because they never liked my answer for their questions when it came to my grades. No matter how much I told them I forgot about an assignment or just did poorly on a test. Never did I ever see them helping me try to increase those grades. They would just say, “you need to study more.” When the reality was I didn’t know how, and every time I tried it wouldn’t work. I still won’t tell my family my diagnosis because I don’t want to hear their response. I know they will just tell me it’s just an excuse for being the way I am. I am sorry you too have had similar struggles. It’s hard not to feel I could have gone so much further in my life if I would have just had a little help  and understanding as a child. It is tough! I am super proud of you for taking the steps to finding answers and help. I too was stuck in the feeling that it was only something that occurred in children. You got this! I hope you continue to progress in your journey to coping with having an ADHD brain."

I had suspected for a little while, I began questioning people in my life in 2016 but was repeatedly told that I was too smart to have ADHD. Well they were right, my IQ is above average (did the psychoeducational test for DX), but I absolutely have ADHD. I was mad at EVERYONE. I knew my pediatrician was shit because of experiences with literal physical injuries in my teens (I was a rugby player, I ABSOLUTELY needed more than the ibuprophen he was prescribing me), so that was just another nail in that coffin. But my teachers (my kindergarten teacher thought I had a hearing disability, the doc said \"selective hearing\")? My PARENTS?? \n\nSince my DX my sister has determined that she very likely has autism (undx, she doesn't have the drive or $ to be dx). My mom initially said my ADHD probably came from my dad, and it very well could have, but my ADHD tips and tricks that I've shared with her have worked REMARKABLY WELL, and other conversations have heavily pointed at her and her family (both my cousins are dx adhd, too).\n\nEventually you have to move past the anger. It is a stage of grief, and you are grieving the life you thought you were living. But soon clarity will come. So many dots will be connected and questions answered. You will also likely get to a point where you're like, \"Cool, my entire personality is symptoms. I am nothing but ADHD\", and that is a shitty point to reach, too, but it will also pass as you determine that your brain, ADHD or not, is still YOU. All of us experience and exhibit our symptoms differently, and our brains create our experience, nothing in your life escapes the shadow cast by ADHD. But it's not a BAD thing, it's just a thing. \n\nWhatever trick of magic/my brain has blessed me with, I have always had a strong sense of self, and this has made much of my experience easier to accept/move through. I like me, I like my quirks, I will not be quiet about having ADHD despite the obvious judgement some people react with. I am very fortunate to work in a place that heavily values training and therefore is willing to test folks for learning disabilities, so I've never had to be quiet about my diagnosis at work. It is a definite privilege. I've been in the closet before and it's somewhere I don't intend on existing ever again, and I feel this way about having ADHD. It is as much me as my gender identity, my sexuality, my distaste of red meat, my preference for black clothing. It is a fact about me. \n\nI hope that soon you will also find peace in your dx, that your family and friends are supportive, and that stimulant medication works for you with minimal side effects ;)"

My wife and I talked about that conversation afterward and she told me there was a ridiculous stigma around ADHD in the 90’s and 2000’s that’s made a lot of Gen X parents get the idea that ADHD is a nurture over nature disorder and they’re at fault. But I explained to my mom all the same thing; I worked 4 times as hard as my peers in school growing up to make half the grades. I hated myself and brain feeling stupid all the damn time. And the frustration of knowing I’m not but not understanding why my brain just didn’t cooperate led me to some dark thoughts as a young teenager.

NOOOOO I have to get all the info myself and them they will decide if I have them or not. (Its the VA so they don't want to pay for what I'm owed)\n\nWhy do people in general have to fight for anything that should be provided by default? Like, you need people to work in order to run an infrastructure like a country, and they can't do that if they aren't being treated for injuries, illness, or disability. Why make it hard to get medical support, and also make it nearly impossible to afford?!"

    "comment": "oh newbie here. You're not alone!! I was diagnosed at 47(!) -- a blame-shame parenting household labelled me as \"impatient, impulsive, irresponsible, selfish trouble-maker\". When I got older, my family doctor referred me to a very kind anxiety therapist (10 years on) who then recommended me to get psychiatric testing $$ (working PT no health benefits!) Me too! I also felt validated and angry as well. \n\nI was \"high-functioning\" at school and work but forgetful about little things (leaving things on trains, mixing up weekend event dates) and interrupt coz I can't contain my excitement / questions / comments when an interesting topic pops up...\n\nI started on Concerta 18mg last year. 6 months later, I went up to 27mg. This year though, I had a few bad anxiety-depression episodes (mental & physical chronic illness-ridden parents, job / financial stress, mid-life health changes) so maybe I need to up my focus-energy to 54(?) \n\nYou seem to be able to \"hyper-focus\" on certain tasks e.g. the long hours of trauma training. Me too, academically and professionally. I guess school & family friends and coworkers may have noticed some symptoms, but they aren't health professionals so they wouldn't have been confident that you have ADHD. I have friends in medical fields --- how could they not tell me?! Oh well. Cat is out of the bag. And I like cats in general. Take care and best wishes. We are not alone."

The thought never even occurred to me til my mental health therapist pointed it out when talking about my struggles with having to rest. Im a go go go type of person, I always need to be doing something. I can't just sit around doing nothing. My struggles definitely showed way more after having hip surgery 8 months ago. I was going crazy cuz I had to take it easy and I'm not use to it. Even when on crutches if I had a chance to leave the house I took it. When I did the testing they asked about my childhood. I said I was always go go go and would run laps outside around the house. When I told him that I was oh yeah thats a red flag for ADHD. My parents never caught that something was wrong cuz I was always a busy kid. I'm struggling still with my hip surgery recovery. Hip is telling me to take it easy, my mind is still wanting to do everything. And I also suffer with chronic migraines. So all this together is super hard!"

I showed interest but never did well. I don’t know why I started researching ADHD symptoms, but I did. I finally decided to see a doctor about it, but I did. I’m now 33 and have been on Adderall for over a year; this last year, I’ve passed two certification programs and gotten a new job and a promotion after six months. I’ve thought about what my life would be like if I started taking my prescription earlier in life, and it sometimes bothers me, but I tell myself things happen for a reason.

I had a Pink Lady's leg razor that the staff gave me and one of those scissors that the kids used with the rounded ends just to make sure I kill myself.\n\nWhile I was in mental hospital I saw a guy sink the 8 ball on the break 2 times in a row that was way cool.\n\n And I did try to brain a guy with a pool cue that took cuts in front of me.  staff grabbed me up and said if I couldn't be good I'd have to go back to my room so I settled down. I saw the guy later in group therapy he said I scared the crap out of him and I smiling right now.\n\n I actually do not know how to fight and I have avoided going to places where my mouth would get me in trouble like where people drink because I don't drink.\n And I was always afraid of the happy alcoholic trying to force me to drink and I would have to Defend myself but I don't think it actually happens it was just my overactive imagination.\n\nAnd that really cost me an opportunity to hunt womenJudge me for saying that because Travis  kelce says the same thing and he's my hero.\n\n I've met a lot of angels along the way and I have been able to modify my behav your based on their wisdom. Immediately it took me almost 40 years to figure out what this plumber was telling me and he said to me and I quote\n Just because you're having a bad day fella don't try to ruin mine.\n\nI did not know how to do that behaved myself not use my sarcastic whipped to destroy people and then I would get taken down and return but I got a skin like stainless steel and it doesn't bother me go ahead punch me I don't care sticks and stones will break my bones but names will never hurt me that's what my mother said she was wrong she was wrong about a lot of things and I got real issues with females I do.\n\nBought I am trying to talk to women my age more or less I had to lie about my age they said I could only join if I was 70 and I was already in my late 70's I think can't remember. I have almost no short-term memory and I lost my sense of smell during covid and I've been trying hard to educate my brain but so far I might have to consult somebody about that.\n\nReally do it yourself or I like to fix myself and if I can't do that then I go and I seek wisdom. I did take addoral 20 mg for about 1 year when I was on probation. \nI wanted to see what it did and poke the bear. \n\nIt was my eyes. I had to look right at what I was doing . Sometimes I close my eyes and use my sense of touch. \n\n I was gonna be legally blind so I was getting ready but then they invented LASIK surgery and I was home free.\n Found out that my right eyeball wasn't round and that's why my contact kept falling off and giving me grief.\n\nSo I don't wear glasses anymore and one of the greatest triumphs was unchecking the block on my driver's license I am no longer restricted I don't have to wear glasses.\n\nVictories are hard to find in an AD HD person's life sometimes and gotta celebrate the small ones.\n\nI wish you the best of luck and I hope that you will adapt or adopt excuse me and attitude gratitude considering me alternative you're alive you might not be happy but there might be hope for you down the road 1 day at a time.\n\nI've been sober for over 40 years 1 day at a time I don't know if I have the power not to take a drink for the rest of my life but I know I can do it just this 1 day."

My big sister got her diagnosis at 29 (I was only 24 then). \n\nADHD \"makes sense\" for my sister because she is hyper, fidgety, scatter-brained, and impulsive, and has always been that way since very young in childhood. \n\nBut after she got her diagnosis and we talked there were a ton of things she learned about herself, and more than just a coincidental amount of 'symptoms' I related to in a way no one else around her did. I began to wonder if maybe I also had ADHD but my family, my husband (who was diagnosed in elementary school with ADHD), and everyone else around me was basically like \"we just don't see it\". \n\nI have always 'struggled with anxiety' horrible overthinking loops, amd hyperfixation, I could only do well in school if I gave my absolute 200% effort, otherwise I'd miss small details, or forget to turn things in, and find myself quickly on a path to flunking. \n\nI'd been on anti depressants on/off since I was 12. I've done years of therapy. And nothing ever helped, nothing ever clicked or did what it was \"supposed to do\". I have spent most all of my life just observing others and attempting to be \"perfect\". I have felt defective and broken. \n\nFinally last year, I decided to ask my doctor about it, and she did an assessment and put in a referral for other testing. And yep, I am definitely ADHD. So I started adderall, and the difference is eerily remarkable. It was so jarring and almost frightening how much quitter my mind was. When the meds would begin to wear off and I'd enter into my \"normal\" I would immediately be overwhelmed, and on edge, because how? How the fuck did I just walk through life that way for 28 years!? \nSo yes I definitely relate to being angry that it was missed all this time."

We really do have our parents to blame, and of course they're in denial. My mom only tried a few doses of anti-depressant and gave up. She never seek further medical help or family support. I guess we're products of our times. Her generation isn't aware of such abstract health concepts.\n\nVery few people would admit: \"hon, I'm sorry I didn't recognize my and your symptoms and get help sooner. I hope this didn't screw up too much of your career, relationships and life in general.\" \n\nIt's uncomfortable and exhausting to support your loved ones on a chronic difficult issue \"what if I fail / disappoint them?\" so people typically dismiss it, very unfortunate lost opportunity to bond with our friends and family.\n\nInto 21st century there are still so much stereotyping, still thinking MH issues are attitude problems, no empathy at all. \"MH people are either crazy dangerous delusional, or dumb unresponsive underperforming at work/ school i.e. can't answer math-skill testing question in a contest\". Any mood disorders, sleep problems, compulsive behaviour should be \"disciplined\"... I'm glad at least the younger generation is more open to difficult discussions. Take care."

While at home I can't even get myself to brush my teeth every day, or shower every day or every other even. I decided to cut my beard shorter, but haven't shaved since, so now it's as long and unruly as before.

When you're talking about the Hyper active part\". That pause before the hyper activity part was long enough for my doubts to come back and they're staying, so here I am again, questioning it all.

I know I have the inattentive one if anything, at least mentally, because I do have tics and can't sit still physically, but my mind is mostly empty a lot, or it might be full of incoherent thoughts???\n\n I'm 31 and have an easy life but feel like i'm always lacking behind on everything.

    "comment": "Sure! Most children with ADHD are corrected and scolded much more frequently than their classmates, often for things we can’t help and or don’t notice. As another commenter said earlier, our symptoms are often treated as a moral failing. This tends to lead to high levels of anxiety. \n\nBy our teen years, the anxiety can be severe enough that we’ll do anything to avoid drawing attention to ourselves. That can take the form of not doing anything;  not just because of executive dysfunction, but because we just can’t figure out what the safe action is. Mind you, the ADHD hasn’t STOPPED in any way, it’s just become internal hyper vigilance regarding our own behavior.  And because it’s now internal and less disruptive for others- it’s clearly no longer a problem! Right? /s\n\nFor example: Every one of my early elementary school report cards said, “Not working up to potential”. By high school I had learned to hide that potential. I was terrified that someone would finally realize that I was trying as hard as I could, I just wasn’t as “smart” as they had thought. So, I quit letting people see that I was trying at all. I got a reputation for being rebellious, but I just couldn’t figure out what I was supposed to do.\n\nThis isn’t the same for everyone with ADHD, of course. Some people with ADHD can be properly supported and learn techniques to adjust, some times by their teen years (sometimes much later). And some of us find a path that just better suits us than being graded on our ability to sit still and be the same as others our age. \n\nThere are more choices as we get older, whether by adaptation or trauma, ADHD symptoms often become less noticeable at puberty. No less difficult for the individual with ADHD, but less apparent to those around them."

I don't speak for her on her feelings, but in general it has just mellowed everything out and allowed her to take every day in stride and think through things more calmly. It definitely took some time to kick in, maybe a month or so, and the results were very subtle...as in, it's not like she takes a pill and BAM, it hits her.\n\n  Edit: pretty sure a day or so ago, there was a post on here about folks' experience with the drug; check it out if you can find it."

No more depression, able to somewhat concentrate, wayyy less anxious and less noise in my head. I have to lower the dose to 40 from 80 due to side effects but it's still worth it. \n\nI also started taking Adderall recently to help with focus but honestly it hasn't helped much at all.\n\nThe positive that I got from this pill has been a life changer for me. I always thank my doctor for suggesting it when I first saw him. Didn't even know anything about ADHD.\n\nAlso fix my emotional regulation problems.

I started at 20mg in January and am on 80mg right now (June). \nI knew I needed to up the dose because I started to feel how I did before the med. Once I increased my dose it went away. \n\nMy thoughts slowed (to a normal pace instead of 13719mph with 3 lanes), I don’t need to ~self medicate~ to get easy chores done, I have much better short term memory. I sleep 7-8 hours a day instead of 10-11, I don’t need 2-3 hour daily naps. I don’t get as frustrated or overwhelmed. \nThe only side effect I have is I’m constantly thirsty - the med dehydrates me & if I don’t drink enough water I get a headache.\n\nEdit: sorry I’m a few months late to this"

Started at 40 and was sort of feeling some improvement - anxiety was being managed way better and the thoughts would calm down enough that I could sleep at a reasonable time. \n\nI sought medication when work stress was so high I felt like I was a thread away from a mental breakdown. So this at least brought me back to my usual \"insane\" self. The one issue was that PMS essentially canceled the benefits since symptoms went into turbo mode - so now I'm at 60 and have constant epiphanies that I'm now able to operate like a \"normal\" person. \n\nI've been fortunate enough to not deal with any inhibiting side effects (at least haven't noticed) besides a terrible stomach ache if I take it on an empty stomach. I used to be the type to take pills without water but this is NOT one for that. The capsule ends up getting stuck in my esophagus and when it dissolves or I cough, the medicine inside burns like hell."

I was rushed through an intake and unable to express my fear that things would get worse, that it WAS working just enough to keep me on this side of the brink of personal or professional disaster. Turns out that’s probably true. \n\nQ for others - Would it be worth increasing my dose first? It’s already giving my dry mouth and I have a bad cavity that can’t be treated for another month.

Told my doctor, but he kept saying to give it more time until I hit the lowest I have ever been in my life and almost completed the thing... Luckily I didn't! And my psychiatrist finally decided to try stimulants and I eventually switched doctors and I'm doing much better now! \n\nIt's a series of trial and error, mostly error, but also, advocate for yourself and drop doctors who don't take your responses seriously. Afterall, you're the one dealing with the experience, not the doctor. And psychiatric meds do not affect every person the same way"

But, because of the anxiety and insomnia fueled secondary hypertension, I can't get a prescription for stimulants, even though we've conclusively concluded that my ADHD-induced anxiety is the primary cause of my blood pressure issues, and the insomnia from the wrong ADHD medication for my needs, but my doctor won't budge out of caution. :-(\n\nI don't want stimulants either, really, but it's obvious to me that stimulants are the correct solution. The only drug I like is 420 - I don't drink alcohol to get drunk (I dislike being buzzed/drunk), but because I enjoy some drinks. I don't even care for caffeine - I'm happy with decaf coffee, and would rather have pepsi 0 caffeine free, if it existed.\n\nSo I'm caught in a conundrum preventing actually fully solving my ADHD struggles. Sigh.\n\nMy mother did me a huge disservice shrink-shopping to get a shrink to rule out ADHD. If she had accepted that my being all over the place interest-wise was actually an ADHD symptom, and that stimulants fixed it, I'd still be on ritalin or adderall today and would have avoided that 35+ year battle with anxiety that I went through. She said ritalin made me \"like a zombie\" when really, it caused me to be able to focus on the drudgery of the here and now."

I did notice I've put on a little weight, but it also was around the time I officially entered my late 20s and I was borderline underweight to begin with so I don't know if the Strattera was the only cause. I maybe put on 10-20 lb over the course of a year or so? I can't say 100% since I've had some issues with disordered eating and I don't weigh myself very often. But it seems to have stabilized, I've been the same weight for a while now, and my doctor didn't seem concerned.\n\nI know some people have really bad side effects on Strattera but I've been lucky, so it could be much worse! But it's one of those things where you have to measure the pros and cons of a medication and its side effects to see if it's worth staying on. It's worth it for me at the moment, but it might not be for another person."

The efficacy dies down around 4pm sometimes so I have to push through that. The dizziness is gone. My heart does feel kinda weird if I take strattera and go for a run right after (6am) so I’ve started taking it after I’m done with running. No issues if I run later in the day. \n\nIt helps mostly with energy and focus - my mood is still pretty snappy/short and I struggle with emotional regulation.

But you'll get there, friend! \n\nIt's sometimes disheartening to read about other people's experiences with their \"magic\" med that suddenly allows them to experience the \"quiet\" or the way \"non-ADHD\" brains feel. I'm still trying to find that sweet spot...but, if you feel up to it, consider where you are now compared to where you were before.

My overall comparison between the two is that the Strattera does a lot of work subtly or filling in the gaps. The adderall feels a lot more active.

I don't get angry anymore like I used to.  I don't look at tasks and feel overwhelmed and defeated before even starting anymore.  For instance, I struggled with housecleaning a lot.  I'd take one look at a room and walk away because it was too much for me.  I'm able to break it down and do the entire room at once now.  My biggest problem was waking up in the morning.  I used to set several alarms and have my mom call me.  Now I just need one alarm and I'm up immediately. I am going to ask to bump up a little bit though, because I feel like it could do better.

It’s really hard to explain how you feel different because it’s so shuttle. But it felt too faint/distant. Upped it to 60 and it’s been working great. But then started sweating a ton. Tried to lowering it to 50, but didn’t like that at all, plus my my doctor said they didn’t make 50 so it was a 40 pill + a 10 pill and my insurance wouldn’t cover the 10 at all. So I decided to go back to 60. Wish I could figure out what to do about the sweating, because I feel like it’s helping. I do feel like I need to be a little more conscious of my mood though."

Prior, I had problems with executive function as well as getting stuck on negative thoughts for days. Now, the friction between me starting a task and managing day-to-day around the house/to-do list stuff is much less. I spend much less mental energy trying to make myself do things, and experience fewer perfectionist tendencies. Less obsessing over things, a bit better focus, thought wasn’t a big symptom for me. I did have some weird side effects when I started that took at least 2 weeks to get past - some temperature regulation/cold hands and feet, and weirdly uncomfortable hard nipples sometimes. I’m past that point and at most experience some dry mouth since increasing the dose to 80 mg. It’s possible that will fade away over time as well."

However, after a couple of hours of taking my first dose I started feeling like my wife (girlfriend then) is trying to piss me off on purpose and I couldn’t tell why (it’s pretty hard to piss me off even if you try), then i started noticing that everyone else also is trying to piss me off. Then it hit me, everyone was acting normal, i was extremely paranoid. I didn’t even tell my wife cause I thought she might pick up a fight with me (peak paranoia) the symptoms lasted 2 days, it was literal hell. I thought everyone was after me, it was only the second day that i started reading the side effects and saw paranoia (I avoid reading the side effects cause of the placebo effect)\nLater I found out that the chance of having paranoia on atomoxetin is very low but when it happens the symptoms might not go away for a long time \nNo straterra related, but I also had hallucinations on an SSRI once\nMy brain apparently loves weird super rare side effects"

    "comment": "Hello! I usually just lurk and don't respond but as a long time user of Effexor (extended release) and Dexamphetimine (generic version of Dexedrine, but I believe mine is immediate release), and someone who has OCD, depression and ADHD, I hope I can help you a bit! I personally started antidepressents at 15, first on Lexapro which only made my OCD worse, then I tried Effexor, originally at 150 mg I believe. Over the years I've had to increase my dosage steadily (I am on 225 mg now at 23, and I am on an anti-psychotic now as well to manage my OCD pseudo hallucinations) as life has become more stressful, which has in turn made the mental health issues worse, but it has consistantly helped me manage it by easing my OCD + ADHD combined brainfog and in general making my emotions easier to manage. It has also helped me with my dissociation and depersonalisation, so if you have those it may be helpful. My Dex has been great personally, though I do probably need to try an extended release along with it, but like I said it's immediate release afaik, so perhaps try that along side a low dose of an extended release.\n\n\n\nThe only thing I would warn you about with Effexor is that I had constant nausea, intense drowsiness, trouble sleeping, dry mouth, and some dizziness, for well over a year. Apparently most side effects are supposed to be short term, but not that was not the case for me. However, having my head mostly clear from the OCD torrent was worth it for me, just something to keep in mind. Additionally, if I accidentally skip a day of taking it I get brain zaps/benzo shakes, and the brain fog comes back fulllllll force; it is a very panic inducing feeling, so if you do start it make sure to be consistent!\n\n  \nSorry for the wall of text! I highly recommend Effexor for people like us who need treatment for multiple issues at once, it definitely has helped me. If you want more information on medications and stuff like that, too, I really recommend looking up each one and taking a good look through the Mayo Clinic and Wikipedia pages and getting familiar with the science behind the drugs you're taking so you can sort of get the mechanisms that your brain responds well to. If you have any questions please feel free to dm me! I've been taking these goddamn things so long, I'm more than happy to help with what I've learned :) Good luck on your journey!"

Currently, I'm at 60mg daily, and while the effect isn't earth-shattering, for me, it removes much of the reluctance at starting tasks. I catch myself doing things and thinking, \"Wow, I started cooking dinner, doing the dishes, taking out the trash, exercising, etc., practically without noticing. When there is reluctance, it's not hard to push past it. And while my brain is quieter, it hasn't affected my creativity or lateral thinking.\n\nI was drowsy for the first couple of weeks, but that's mostly gone. The research shows Strattera is effective enough for about 40% of the people who try it compared with stimulant medications. It looks like I'm in that 40%.

I'm glad to hear that it has helped you, and I am hoping that it can do the same for me because I simply can't live like this anymore.\n\nThat is very interesting about the sexual side effects -- I may be too naive, but what do you mean about the order of operations? My prozac definitely makes it harder for me to cross the finish line, but not impossible. Formerly, I was on Trintellix, and that made it absolutely impossible -- never again lol.\n\nIn terms of stimulants, I am on 30mg of sustained-release dexedrine (all at once) per day and have not been able to notice benefits, so I'm starting to get worried that I am just medication resistant, or too high tolerance or something :(  As a background, I am 25 F, slim, and have never used stimulants before, so I'm shocked that the effects aren't as pronounced as anticipated.\n\nBut overall, I am really glad to hear that you have found something that works for you, and I appreciate the positive results you're seeing! :)"

Strattera is known to cause them in general for both, usually inhibition. That is what was strange to me, as I don’t have the normal sexual side effects of anything being inhibited.\n\nI know Wellbutrin may potentially enhance, or at least reverse negative effects with SSRIs for both men and women, though. I was on it for a while (new doctor went there for ADHD first), but I’m trying to stay on the least quantity of drugs, so I tapered off that weeks ago. \n\nHang in there, hopefully you find a good fit for medication!

Atomoxetine does take a while to work, like 4-8 weeks according to some sources (I AM NOT A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL, THIS IS NOT MEDICAL ADVICE). I get how frustrating this can be. Unfortunately, picking meds for ADHD is somewhat of a trial-and-error process. However, I thought i could share a few things about me and adhd meds to help you be more at ease: \n\n1. For me, I felt no real difference with both atomoxetine OR guanfacine. My doctor wanted to start me on nonstimulants first because I also have major depressive disorder, OCD and generalized anxiety disorder. She was worried that stimulants would worsen it for me. After using the guanfacine for a while (which, like atomoxetine did not work), she eventually gave me Vyvanse (Lisdexamfetamine) - a stimulant. It is working somewhat at 40mg, but it does not seem to be as effective as I would like it to be. Still have to use my therapy skills, which Vyvanse helps by making it easier to do so.\n\n2. I understand why your doctor wanted to tackle your depression and anxiety first. They both can mimic ADHD, and prescribing a stimulant for someone who has untreated anxiety may make it worse. My alma mater's student clinic had a dedicated psychologist to test for ADHD (he was such an asshole, but not the point). So, I had to pay for a psychiatrist off-campus to diagnose me with adhd. \n\n3. Your doctor CAN start you on a low dose of a stimulant (they may use vyvanse or concerta to start off with) to see how you react. The starting dose of vyvanse for example, is 30mg for ADHD. Since you have a history of anxiety, they may start you at 10 or 20 mg to see how you're doing. If it's all manageable, they can adjust the dose by 10-20mg a week. I started at 20mg, and was super frustrated by how it did jack shit. \n\n4. If that doesn't work well with you, they can try shifting you to another class of stimulants or even try augmenting your dosage with a second short-acting stimulant. If stimulants are not helping at all, they can try other nonstimulants (like guanfacine, clonidine). They can prescribe other nonstimulants off label too (like venlafaxine), and even modafinil (a stimulant, but off-label for ADHD and a lot milder than amphetamines/methylphenidates). \n\n  \nLet me know if you found this helpful, or if I can tell you something more to help you feel more at ease. (again, NOT MEDICAL ADVICE, I AM NOT A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL)\n\nYou got this!"

I'll keep fingers crossed it starts working for me too, then!\n\nMay I ask did you suddenly notice everything ADHD-related getting better in a short amount of time (I mean, once it started 'kicking in') or it was starting slowly and getting better over time?\n\nI'm afraid that even if it starts working, I won't necessarily be able to tell clearly, because I've struggled with that quite a bit ever since I started seeing the psychiatrist. But maybe none of the meds have been working (like, AT ALL), that's why I struggled."

    "comment": "I noticed changes in my sleep at about the 4 week mark - drowsiness a while after I’d take it and I started waking up earlier and much more sharply at about 6 and 7am, irrespective of whether I’d been in bed for 8 hours or 4 hours. I’m the sort of person who usually wakes really reluctantly and takes a long time, so that was a really sudden and noticeable change. That’s actually eased off a bit now, but it’s still made positive changes to my sleep. This was the primary reason I shrugged and kept taking it even when I figured it wasn’t going to make much different at that point.\n\nThe other changes were definitely more subtle - it was more like at week 6 I suddenly noticed differences in my mood and motivation compared to how I had been feeling for the last few years (I‘ve been recuperating from a significant case of burnout over the last two years) and when I reflected I realised it had started to subtly improve my mood and motivation around week 4, but the change was only big enough for me to notice anything by week 6 or 7. I’m not sure if I would have found much of a change if I’d taken it in 2020 compared to now though. I’m also on 40mg of Vyvanse a day and that’s definitely doing the heavy lifting in symptom management. But the combination has given me back an enthusiasm for life I didn’t realise was missing until now that has been holding me back. I guess it’s probably having an antidepressant effect? tbch I‘m not sure how beneficial anyone in different circumstances would find what I’ve experienced, but it’s pretty pleasant surprise. \n\nKeeping track of how you feel over the next couple of weeks should help you see if there’s been any changes at least. Hope things work out for you, finding the right medication for anything is an exhausting process."

I'm not sure if I've ever read it's one of them.  \nAnyway, that's my big thing as well - I almost never wake up rested and most of the time I'm both angry and perhaps could say even depressed, in the morning. Super irritable, sensitive to sound etc. Sometimes it's a bit better and sometimes it's really bad, no matter how many hours I sleep. And there's no really pattern - I could sleep less and wake up feeling better.\n\nMood & motivation are huge, too. As well as focus. I lack focus so much, it makes me sad. If these would get better, that would actually change my life.  \nI'll see how it goes in the upcoming weeks, and will ask my doc about the supporting meds (potentially).\n\n  \nI'll try to keep track, that's a good idea, although, I feel like it could be giving me some placebo effect, because I want it to work so much that I think something might've gotten better. I'm afraid I won't really know if it's really happening or not.  \nHonestly, even if it was giving me a placebo effect, I wouldn't care, as long as I can have motivation, focus and other things. :D But let's see."

Wife and I had some alone time. When I finished, it felt strange almost painful, when I ejaculated it felt sharp coming out (if that makes any sense) Left a weird feeling in my penis for about 30 minutes afterward. The ADHD is only slightly better. My doctor started me out on this med at first for 30 days as he told me this is his personal preference in case it does the trick. I had been on Vyvance up until 2015 and that worked great. Employment issues made me stop taking that to get hired, random screening kept me off. They didn't care, I was working at a school district.

But they did lessen after about 2mo. It was effective for my hyperactive mind/anxiety the first day but took about 8 weeks to see the full benefits of the medication. I went from 40mg to 80mg to 100mg (gave me panic attacks and tachycardia do we decreased back to 80mg). I will say that every time I increased dosage, the side effects would come back until the 2mo mark. But if you can make it through that initial period you should start feeling better. If not I recommend trying something else. Most complain of nausea but I only got that 30 min after taking it for 2 days. I always take food with it and that helps. I do have insomnia with it too. That has been the hardest to tolerate since it never went away."

I was on it for two months. It did help with my concentration and memory. It did not help with much else. The juice was certainly not worth the squeeze. Horrible bladder control. It would sometimes take minutes to empty it. If I moved the wrong way it would open a little in I had to use all my willpower to hold it until I got to a restroom. I could get half-assed erections for approximate one minute at a time (ED meds did not help solve this). Constipation so severe it would cause pain in my testicles and abdomen regularly. All in all an objectively awful experience. The only reason I stayed on it for two months and didn't just stop and deal with being unmedicated was because my spouse noticed a huge difference in me outwardly. Evidently it did something more than I could feel or I had some other issues that it helped solve. Now I'm on Adderall and things are great. Im having zero side effects.

Like if I say in my head 5 min passed it turns out it's 2 min. I googled about it and norepinephrine actually does control the perception of time so that was one shocker for me. But then it I didn't feel anything.\n\nA month later I got a higher dose and man it gave me headaches and practically made it impossible for me to sleep for some reason.\n\nA month later I noticed I started sweating ALOT. And I am not a person that sweat alot. It was summer yes but that was crazy alot. I googled again and that is one of the side effects... Including the sleep problems.\n\nThe final one that made me stop it completely is I felt this suffocating feeling during sleep like I was ghasphing for air but my body doesn't want to breath. I litteraly was like damn I am dead. The only way I breathed was I pushed my slef of bed to wake my body up. I was confused and when I googled again it turned out it's a rare side effect. Basically when we fall asleep out body starts breathing in a specific manner that is slow and shallow. And the medication made this happen when I am a fully aware and not sleep that's why the painc that I was having.\n\nIf you still planning to take it you can try it but that was my experience only. Yours may differ.\n\nEdit: why not try ritalin or Adderall?"

This has changed, for the first time in years I'm feeling that I'm getting ready to start building a relationship again. I started taking it in the evening to help nausea symptoms and tiredness. But my WHOOP tracked an elevated heart rate of 5-8 BPM and much less REM and DEEP sleep; that's why I switched back to morning.\n\nSide effects I have permanently:\n\n\\- If I drink alcohol on it I get depressed for a few days >2 glasses is a no go for me  \n\\- Sometimes nausea when taking in the morning  \n\\- More tired in the evening on social gatherings. It's like I still have a good focus but my brain is to tired to make up any words  \n\\- Higher hearth rate  \n\\- Peeing is hard\n\nSide effects when changing doses:\n\n\\- Retrograde ejaculation (happened 2 times atleast)  \n\\- Messing with libido and ED. I heard Cialis is an option if this persist  \n\\- Mood swings  \n\\- Cold chills under the cover that feels to come from the inside out  \n\\- Have to pee a lot  \n\\- Chaotical thoughts which seems hopeless\n\nSometimes even on this med I feel extremelly tired but it's much less common than before this med.

I think I went through 4 different brands of medication and 3 dose levels of each.\n\nOnce we finally found the right dose, it felt more like the medicine was an invisible ghost pushing me lightly in a different direction.

The only side effects I’ve dealt with were mild and went away within a couple weeks.

The high resting heart rate was the kicker for my Dr, she told me to stop taking it as soon as I said that I was standing at my desk with a 140bpm pulse. \n\n\nI cried for days, because *it had worked*, and I was back to nothing and my caffeine tolerance was shot and one cup had me shaking.

I was able to focus and I was happier. I really felt like the best version of myself. Unfortunately, I had a rare side effect (asymptomatic tachycardia) and was switched over to Ritalin, which works better in some ways, but worse in others.

I know someone who had events of a really high heart rate, but they became less and less till they never happened again. This is going to be a shitty week, but you should find some help out the other side of it.\n\nIf you still prefer 24/7 help there's other meds too, straterra doesn't have to be your only option if the side effects persist or simply suck too much up front. But all of them have an on ramp of a month, or more if they need to up your dose. That's just the way they go. If they're going to work all day, they need to build up in your system for a few weeks."

If you can see minor improvements in both, but it’s still problematic (then your dose is most likely still too high, and you should probably try to reduce it again)"

I, like you, took it at night the first time and had a horrible night's sleep. I now take it in the daytime. I find that it's about 80% as effective as a stimulant, but you need to still have that willpower to get the work done.\n\n\nIn terms of how you feel and control, Strattera is the equivalent of wind power on a ship, and a stimulant is more like a jet engine on a go kart. A stimulant feels like you're being shoved and pushed, whereas Strattera is more like a gentle nudge and you get to steer and direct. \n\n\nI started on Adderall XR and then switched to Strattera because I didn't like the increased heart rate or blood pressure that I have when I am on the stimulant. I don't feel as it is much when I'm on Strattera. \n\n\nHowever, in the last year and a half, due to burnout from stress at work and in life, I asked my doctor and he added a low dose prescription for Adderall IR, 5 mg. I use a pill splitter to split the dose and will take half of it in the morning and then the other half in the afternoon if I'm suffering from inertia and lack of willpower.\n\n\nCombined with exercise, it's been pretty helpful."

I can definitely focus better but it hasn’t done anything for my hyperactivity, and it hasn’t made me feel more motivated or more capable the way I felt when I once took Ritalin. My family tells me they can see a difference though! And there weren’t really negative side effects. I had some trouble sleeping at first and some weird dreams, but that went away after a few days. It’s worth trying in my opinion, I think it’s a hit or miss for most people!"

I dropped once for a couple days then got back to 80 mg then 100 mg which is the highest dose prescribed. And I definitely understood the difference better. I would also say that it helps with emotional dysregulation as well, but not drastically. I still struggle with motivation, chronic procrastination, executive dysfunction and problems that sort tho. \n\nI also didn’t face any significant side effects, by significant I mean that affect my life in a bad way. But my minor things. \n\nSo it helps but still a lot to do"

    "comment": "My doctor told me the same about the Strattera, but I really didn't notice any difference besides fatigue. But like I said I didn't take it very long either. I think the reason stimulants can cause anxiety is because some people do get like a racing heart rate. It's a stimulant.. so it's kind of \"energizing\" I guess I'd call it? But a lower dose and/or eating before you take it can help if it's too much. \n\nBut yea, I think in my case, it helped with anxiety because the ADHD was causing it, as well as depression. I have tried soo many different meds to try to get anxiety and depression under control, and not many made much difference at all, and the ones that did didn't last long. I told my doctor I really didn't want to try another one. I was kinda just giving up on it. They said we needed to treat depression and anxiety before adhd, and that just wasn't working for me so I was done. My doctor said then that I had a point, and with the long list of meds that didn't work, she was willing to try treating the adhd first instead. Went through a couple non stimulants, decided to try Adderall, and finally after 17 years I didn't have any symptoms of depression and only scored 1 point for anxiety at my follow up! It has truly been life changing. \n\nSo don't give up if the first few don't work for you. I think it's better on your body to try non stimulants but ultimately whatever will help you function is going to be best. Wishing you the best!"

But I think it is more ideal and common to increase your dose weekly. If you don’t feel any side effects, you can talk with your doctor and increase it to 60 then 80 gradually, week by week. 80 mg is usually said to be the ideal dose for adults. Tho I’m not a medical professional and I would just recommend you to talk with your doctor and choose right medication strategy with them.

I have never had any experiences like that; in fact, I don't really remember having any side effects whatsoever.\n\nI have been taking Strattera for about 18 months, just at the start of COVID.\nSomeone further down commented that it didn't work for them, and I felt pretty much the same when I started taking it. It never really seemed to have much of an effect on my ADHD, though it was hard to tell without my routine and being stuck at home all the time. \n\nAt some point I realized that I hadn't had a depressive episode for a very long time. My Dr told me that Atomoxetine is approved for use as an antidepressant in some countries, so that made sense.\n\nI still take the Strattera, but also a super low dose of Adderall as needed.

It was so much torture I couldn't sleep and I was stuck in my own mind unable to control my own thoughts. It was definitely dangerous as you describe in that I feared my own life.\n\nThe doctor put me on a lower dose and some sleeping pills. It's much better now though I can tell this lower dose isn't quite enough either. But rather this than the experience I had with the higher dose.

Other factors were involved but adderall was a big part. I wasn’t hospitalized but I recovered eventually and without antipsychotics. Just take it easy. I wasn’t hospitalized or aware of my psychosis so it went on for months unchecked (I was isolated and afraid to tell anyone due to the nature of my delusion). \n\nI have a feeling this won’t happen to you because yours was more intense but shorter lived but I will say that my brain kind of shut down for about a year and I fell really deep into a clinical depression. I felt mildly brain damaged. I have heard that is common after a psychotic break. Antidepressants really helped me cope and get back on my feet. Don’t be hesitant to get treated for depression as well if it happens to pop up. While I still struggle with mild to moderate depression, the severe, physical brain dead depression has never returned and only lasted less than a year.

Thankfully didn't get worse than that based on stories I've heard of people who actually have type 1 bipolar.\n\nMania is probably the one thing I would never like to experience again because even despite hating myself and everything I did after it passed I still kind of miss the confidence and uncaring nature that came with it."

First they prescribed me Strattera which had really bad side effects, then they prescribed something else that was even worse, and then only that did they prescribe Concerta. Each of these meds was for 2-4 weeks, with 2 weeks in between them to wean off. It takes a looong time. Oh, and once you get Concerta they'll enter you into a database and you need to carry a card on you because now you're a drug abuser or something. But yes, it's possible.

The 24 hour coverage is nice, but once I started anti-anxiety medication (Zoloft) I started slipping again even at the max dose. Otherwise, the adjustment period when you first start is a bit rough. I was somewhat lucky in that I noticed positive effects after about two hours, which I suspect is rare. It can also get a bit hard to evaluate the effectiveness properly because you get used to it being in your system 24/7. Having goals or similar to compare against helped me a lot with evaluating the effectiveness. \n\n\nIn my case both medications I tried helped with my anxiety as well, although the Vyvanse helps more overall. I have sensory sensitivity and filtering struggles which it seems results in a lot of anxiety. That said, if you need a non-stimulant option I'd absolutely give Strattera a try. It was definitely helpful for me even if it ended up not quite being effective enough in the end. As far as I'm aware, the way it effects people tends to vary pretty drastically. \n\n\nGood Luck!"

My executive functioning ability has skyrocketed - If I had 10% before I was medicated, I have 60-70% now. My mood is more stable, I have more control of my focus and my energy budgeting, and I generally just get so much more done. Don't get me wrong, I still struggle with stuff. I had a heck of a time with a couple of family crises and a really stressed time at work over the past 6 weeks, so I just managed to make plans with a friend, so they can come body-double me and help me get my apartment under control this coming weekend, because the mess has slipped comepletely out of my control while I was trying to stay afloat at work and support two critically ill family members instead. But before the meds, I wouldn't have had the energy or emotional stability to even ask for help, and would instead have been too embarrassed at the state of my home and started isolating myself. That's not happening this time. \n\nAdditionally, I'm dead lucky and have more or less completely avoided side effects. I had a few headaches at the very early stages when I was still getting used to the effects of the meds, but they went away after a few weeks... Since then, the only other thing is a gradual weightloss - about 10 kgs over the past year. But I had the weight to lose, and it honestly might as well have been due to how my better functioning also means I eat better, healthier and more regularly than I've done in years... \n\nSo yeah. Of course, all meds will have different effects on everyone, so I can promise you no side effects just because I got lucky. But unlike a bunch of the other comments here, I am having the best time with these meds... :)"

I also don’t have a big appetite in the morning so eating enough calories to get me through until the meds wore off was not an option.\n\nIt has been working wonderful for me - it’s much easier to wake up in the morning, I’m more focused at work, I can manage household chores better which leads to the ability to actually have some free time, I’m not exhausted at the end of the work day, it’s been great. My 2 main side effects (especially when I first started) are being REALLY thirsty, but I’ve heard that’s common with stimulants as well and I struggled a long time with the drowsiness-insomnia combo. I was taking it in the evening for a while because it would make so tired when I took it in the morning but if I forgot and didn’t take it by 7pm, I would struggle to fall asleep and stay asleep. My dose also went up at one point and I noticed that even if I did take it by 7, I would still sometimes randomly wake up wide awake at 3, 4 in the morning and not be able to get back to sleep. The number of times I showered at 4:30 in the morning so I could sleep in until 7am is too high… I had a few weeks off from work recently for my wedding and honeymoon where I was able to experiment a little with the time of the day (plus have the flexibility for naps) and I have adjusted to taking it in the morning. If I forget with breakfast I take it with lunch - I try to take mine with meals because I’ve noticed that while it is not really an appetite suppressant, it does sometimes kill my appetite and make me nauseas if I take it on an empty stomach. \n\nI still get the drowsiness sometimes (usually if I take it with lunch, I think when I take it with breakfast the drowsiness is kind of setting in by lunchtime when I’m getting up anyway then I eat and feel better) but I have found making sure I stay hydrated and having a snack helps."

But, I was super emotional for no reason. I cried when I couldn’t figure out the new parking app and had to hide from my friends cause I couldn’t stop lol. Did not help with emotional regulation like vyvanse does for me. Also dry mouth and eyes.\nI still think about the brain power and sometimes want to go back but I felt vyvanse helps me regulate emotions which is more important for my job and day to day. strattera helps with my brain. I wish I could take both."

I took Strattera for a month and found it was helpful in waking up without being tired, or needing coffee, and quieting the noise in my head per se, but it made me so nauseous and tired. I also didn’t like that I had to take it daily. I’m on Vyvanse now, skip it on weekends and get 0 side effects."

They worked ok, but I could never get my prescription filled due to unavailability and when I could it was hundreds of dollars. The straterra costs me way less.\n\n  So far it has helped immensely.  The chatter in my brain is way quieter.  I can just decide to do a task and do it for the most part.  I'm actually using a planner!  Consistently!   \n\nThe only down sides that I've noticed is that I got very constipated (still am a bit but taking psyllium husk and colace)  and had a fluttery heart the first week.  I never got nauseous.  I have had some insomnia but I've been chalking that up to my tooth I had work done on that still hurts.  \n\nHope you find something that works."

    "comment": "I am currently taking Strattera 10mg and have been on this dose for almost 3 weeks. I was taking Vyvanse 20mg prior to this. Vyvanse made me super emotional and angry and I didn't have any patience. I also struggled with intense jaw pain.\n\nSo far, Strattera is good.  I don't notice it \"kick in\" like Vyvanse.  I get sleepy around 2:30 - 3pm but that seems to be going away slowly.  I don't have any issues with sleep on it but I take Clonidine at night.  I find the Strattera helps with my impulsivity and internal restlessness and I am able to focus somewhat, but at times I feel bored.  I get dry mouth but not as bad as it was with Vyvanse, I was drinking 2l of water a day, now it's around 3-4l. I don't feel the need to fidget or move around and my brain is pretty quiet.  My emotional outbursts are getting less but they usually coincide with not eating enough or getting enough sleep.  My appetite decreased significantly with Vyvanse and made me very emotional if I didn't eat. With Strattera, I am hungry around the times I usually eat and if I am late to eating, the emotional intensity isn't as much.  My brain seems to recall information better but sometimes my brain is still a bit scattered.  Overall, I feel it works similarly to Vyvanse but just less intense.  I hope this helps."

Just some points about me for comparison purposes \n- 33f, diagnosed at 30\n- very high anxiety \n- self medicated with high levels of caffeine (Celcius mainly and coffee) prior to diagnosis \n- Qelbree/viloxazine 200mg at night\n- Wellbutrin/bupropion 300mg in AM\n- buspirone 7.5mg 2x day \n\nEven though I was taking a minimum of 200mg of caffeine every day I was worried about the anxiety heightening possibilities of stimulants before they weren’t an option for me. My psychiatrist says that anxiety is the super strength of ADHD and it’s the reason behind the “high function” some of us have, it pushes us forward. He says the trick is finding the balance between enough to keep me on top of life and being too anxious and panicky. It’s why I’m taking the buspirone, it was the pinch of salt to my medication. My obsessive thoughts and purchases have plummeted. It’ll take a while for you to tweak it just right. So if you find yourself still struggling with destructive impulsivity or obsessive thoughts, keep something like buspirone (only used for anxiety, not an SSRI) in your back pocket."

    "comment": "Okay, I’m back for an update because I’ve been on it for like a month now! The Straterra is SO MUCH BETTER for me so far. I’m still not super hungry, but I can actually tolerate eating food (Adderall made me like physically avoid all food but liquid basically), my emotional regulation is much better, and while I’m definitely not perfect, I’m working on tasks and completing things slowly but surely. I CAN focus on something if I want to, but I don’t feel trapped there like I did with Adderall. Example: I have been trying to clean stains off my granite countertops that never got resealed a long time ago. When I was taking Adderall, I would sit there and scrub on a stain for HOURS from like 9 pm - 1 am even though I knew scrubbing it that much at once wasn’t going to help and there were 14 other things I needed to do. I literally could not drag myself away from the counter. Now, I can scrub the counter once for 10 minutes and walk away no problem. The only downside I can see right now is I’m still super sleepy sometimes. Almost every day around 2:30-3 pm I hit a wall and I literally cannot continue until I take a like 20-30 minute nap. Then I’m good for the rest of the day. Hoping the sleepiness wears off but I’d trade that any day for all the benefits I’m seeing. Hope this helps! I can report back again in a while to tell you how it’s going longer term!"

I’m 16f and I’m still in the process of getting a diagnosis.\n\nSo I’d like to ask how was Viloxazine better than Strattera. Yes I may not have the same reaction you have to either medicine but it’s nice to know how these meds affect others. Specifically how it affected your executive functioning (planning and executing those plans, being able to focus on general tasks, if it’s easier to refocus on general tasks if you get distracted, and how it affected any form of procrastination or task paralysis).\n\nThank you for the answer.

I remember sitting (laying like a sloth) on my couch playing a video game and thinking, “Oh I gotta get the dishwasher.” So I *stopped playing* **got off the couch** and ***emptied and refilled the dishwasher***. \nIt didn’t fully hit until after I did it. I didn’t even think about it, I remembered a task and right then and there got up and did it. \n\nDuring my one month check in for the Viloxazine, I told my psych I didn’t feel like myself, kinda empty. It just took longer to fully kick in bc I don’t feel that way now. I didn’t realize how bad my brain fog was until this medicine came in and kicked it out. This was like Strattera but with sprinkles. The Buspirone just took it to the next level. Things that would make me particularly anxious, like homework (in college) are easy peasy. It helped with the lingering procrastination on important things. I feel like a real human.\n\nI’m not a doctor, but please please speak with your doctor about the potential complications combing Strattera and Wellbutrin could have. I asked on here and the woman’s page and didn’t hear a lot about the combo, I googled and didn’t see much. My doctor was ready to increase the Wellbutrin so I just trusted him and did it only to be in the hospital for heart issues two weeks later.

Given that I have ARFID and a low BMI which can cause liver issues Strattera might onset some liver damage because that can be a side effect so I hear.\n\nI’m the same experience with Wellbutrin. But I’m taking two 300 mg every two days because I hear it stays in the system. Before I just took 300 mg per day it didn’t really do anything. It helped with depression and stuff but that was it.\n\nBut now I can literally do stuff and my head is so clear. This is my second time doing two 300 mg but I can feel it more now than the first time. All my anxiousness has gone away and the mundane things give me actual satisfaction to complete. Also my compulsions to eat candy (chocolate in particular) and other impulses are practically gone too and I can control myself. I still experience a lot of thoughts but it’s way easier for me to recenter my attention.\n\nThis is the first time in my life where I feel like I’m in control of my mind and my body. The fog I was in has mostly cleared. I still have a lot of thoughts but the thoughts aren’t anxious depressive ones. They’re good thoughts :3\n\nI’m monitoring any side effects currently and will talk to my psychiatrist about this schedule and if it’s feasible to continue doing. So far I haven’t experienced any negative side effects at all which is good. I’d like to consider taking Viloxazine once I get diagnosed since it’s made specifically for ADHD instead of being an off-label treatment like Wellbutrin.\n\nThank you for sharing with me.

And I haven’t gotten the nausea that most people discuss. I do have a mild “almost bubble guts” feeling, that I’m guessing involves receptors in the gut.\n\nIt’s about 50/50 split of “this is the best thing ever” and “this is straTERRIBLE”, hopefully youre in the former category!"

Had absolutely no side effects nor any changes, good or bad. It did nothing at all. Then the Dr did the genesight test. Learned almost all ssri's don't work well for him. So we tried pristiq next (an snri). EXACT SAME THING. No side effects no change good or bad. Zero help (but was on the list for meds that he can tolerate). \n\nHe transitioned to an adult care Dr that said maybe Trintellix. Weaned and started that (serotonin modulator/atypical antidepressant). He thinks it helps a tad bit. Just a little. So I took him to psych thinking the pediatrician might have missed something. Maybe it is severe anxiety and adhd/inattentive, right?\n\nHe was diagnosed adhd-I, and he (my son) chose to try a non-stim first. So Straterra was started. Well, it IS an SNRI (I think), that mainly inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine alone. Seeing his meds history, I'd honestly be shocked if he had ANY effects and ANY improvements.\n\n\nAll this to say, of all people, this kid is NOT your go-to for comparing side effects of most meds lol.

Not a good fit for me and also not treating the root cause. \n\nGiven my response to SSRIs, I had my doubts about an SNRI, but absolutely did not anticipate this type of reaction. I had actually asked my pharmacist about strattera’s side effects when picking up—primarily concerned with the aforementioned SSRI SEs mentioned—and she admitted she had little experience with and zero reports about the drug. She was mostly just confused as to why they didn’t just prescribe a stimulant given its proven effectiveness and my lack of contraindications.\n\nGood luck to you and your son in finding the right cocktail!

I'm on guanfacine and it's a alpha 2 antagonist (relaxes fight or flight -> lowers bp) which I take daily to mellow out and it's been pretty alright so far. Of course life style changes like hydrating, eating your 3 meals, and dropping the nic in your case also wouldn't hurt.

I had to go to my endo for trt about a month ago before my adhd meds my BP was 110/70 and my hr was around 60. \nIn recent months I’ve had anxiety in the morning but after starting the meds is been better. My sleep quality is also garbage, the irregular heart beat kinda scared the crap out of me."

    "comment": "High systolic (top number) = Stress/Stiffened. It's common with adhd and anxiety. If it was regular hypertension it'd look like 150/97 sitting still all day. The heartbeat thing is probably medication adjustments and it's effect on anxiety. They aren't dangerous but I'd still have the doc look at it for piece of mind. /85 is also fine for something maybe mid day or mild stress.\n\nMornings when you wake up are actually higher bp moments. Your cortisol (stress hormone) levels rise naturally to wake you up in the morning (This is called \"CAR\"). Terrible sleep sounds pretty on the money since you may be flooding earlier in the morning and dropping later resulting in shitty sleep and a shitty awakening. Another case for an alpha antagonist to help you sleep and keep cortisol in check and your body less sensitive to it.\n\nOverall I've lived this hell and picked up this stuff along the way. Your BP sounds like stress and anxiety, the morning BP issue sounds like cortisol spikes in the morning that stick too long (if shitty awakenings are also common then I'm positive), and the heartbeat thing is probably switching and med adjustments which is generally harmless, and the solution is probably something to chill your tone out over night to strengthen your sleep cycle and ease cortisol sensitivity. Or something to ease your response in the morning."

Everyone is different, so I'm sure you'll be fine, and if it works for you, that's what counts. But I had extremely strong side effects(nausea, zero appetite, extreme fatigue) that didn't wane over time, and were worse if I didn't take it immediately after(not before! Not even a minute before!) food. Mentally, it didn't do anything for me for about 2 months, and then, after increasing doses twice up to 80mg, it made me slightly less impatient, improved my short term memory a very small amount, and dulled every single emotion in my brain until I was functionally a zombie. \nIt's worth noting, though, that my brain is probably weird with chemical processing; alcohol doesn't work on me, nor do the ~not allowed to name them directly~ relaxing leaves, and caffeine does *not* make me tired like it does with many ADHD people. So, my experience is probably a huge outlier. Still, it can happen. Be mindful of your body and stay optimistic, you got this. 😁"

    "comment": "I've taken both Adderall and Strattera. I can't speak for everybody, but here are my personal thoughts on both.\n\nAdderall completely \"fixed\" me for like 5-6 hours, but the side effects were nasty. Sleep was impossible, depression, blurred vision, and some other things, it was pretty rough. I believe my dosage was <10mg, I don't remember exactly how much but it was a small amount. My psychiatrist recommended trying a non-stimulant, and Strattera was one I heard a lot about from other people, so I've been trying it out ever since. \n\nI have been taking Strattera for about a year now. I started on 20mg (I think?) but I'm currently at 60mg, and I'll say I'm pretty mixed on the results so far. Strattera is not as effective as Adderall was for *all* of my symptoms, but it definitely helps manage some of my worst symptoms, which have been related to motivation, focusing, and anxiety. \n\nStrattera has NOT helped me with other things such as organization and memory, which are still an issue for me. I've had to work those things out for myself, which I am still working on. \n\nOverall, I like Strattera more than I dislike it, but it's not a miracle pill. The side effects are *mostly* mild and it's nice to have the feeling of actually wanting to accomplish something, both at home or at work. It doesn't fix everything, but it definitely helps in most of the areas I struggled the most with. Adderall definitely worked better for me, but Strattera's side effects are much easier to handle.\n\nSpeaking of the side effects, there are a few that I have noticed. The first is I get irritated much easier. Not *mad*, but more like *annoyed* by small things. It's easy for me to manage though, so I'm fine with it, but elevated anger seems to be a very common symptom of Strattera. \n\nAnother side effect is a slightly elevated heartbeat, it feels like when caffeine first starts to kick in. Once again, it doesn't bother me much, but just be aware that this can happen to you.\n\nThe last side effect that I have noticed is BY FAR the worst: Nausea. When I take my Strattera pill in the morning, I have to either eat food with it right away, OR I have to wait around 2 hours to eat. If I take my pill in the morning on an empty stomach, then eat food 20 minutes later, I get EXTREMELY nauseous. Like, *run to the bathroom and sit for 10 minutes while shaking and sweating* nauseous. It's awful, but I learned quickly why this was happening, and I haven't had it happen in about 9 months now. Just be aware of the time gap and you'll be fine."

Everyone I’ve spoken to seems to feel the same. I’m guessing with the overlap on some depression and ADHD symptoms is why it works for some, but it did not help my ADHD AT ALL.\n\nAlso, to be fair, a LOT of my anxiety was self directed, and about my performance. When I got on Adderall and was actually able to do well, it all sort of went away. If I take my IR too early after my XR, I get a little anxious, but it’s very manageable compared to Wellbutrin."

    "comment": "Strattera isn't a stimulant. It only makes the norepinephrine your brain produces naturally more available for use. Personally, I suspect there are different bio-mechanisms that produce ADHD effects. So, whether it helps depends on what's producing your ADHD. Roughly 40% of people who try Strattera prefer to stay with it over stimulant meds. \n\nI started at 40mg and noticed subtle improvements to my mental clarity and task initiation. Moving to 60mg improved the task initiation part. Without Strattera, my boring tasks are metaphorically all located at the top of a steep hill. To do a task, I have to climb that hill first. With Strattera, the hill's more of a bump. \n\nIt's not that I have great motivation now, but nothing's holding me back either. I just do what needs to get done.\n\nStrattera (Atomoxetine) seems to pair well with Zoloft (Sertraline), a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. The newer ADHD medication Qelbree works on increasing both norepinephrine and serotonin. And that's basically what Atomoxetine and Sertraline do for me.\n\nBut no, Strattera isn't a stimulant. It doesn't require regular urine testing or being put on a controlled substances list."

Completely knocked me out, it was kinda like a light sedation. I work from home and took a short nap. \n\n\nDay. Felt the effects again at the 2 hour mark but not as strong\n\nDay 3. Much less pronounced side effects, mild headache but I feel like I might be starting to see some upside...\n\nFeels like I might be at a crossover point right now, very likely placebo but my focus has felt just a smidge better....\n\nMy sleeps been a little wild too, waking up like 4 times, what's crazy is I'm waking up calmer than usual. My mind hasn't been racing like it had previously. Coincidence? Perhaps\n\nThere's no guarantee that straterra will work for you, but it's typically the first drug in the toolbox before they'll prescribe other options.

    "comment": "Two reasons:\n\n(1) Medication is considered as the first line of defense in ADHD, because it goes directly to the root biochemical cause (of a majority of symptoms, not all).\n\nStimulant medication for ADHD is literally one of the most well-studied classes of drug for a specific condition, and has been the subject of studies and observations for decades. They’re overwhelmingly safe, and they show benefit for approximately 80% of patients. Side effects for most people are mild, and the long term damage that people worry about is so far nil (as far as can be determined).\n\nThis is a *huge* result for a medication of a neurological condition.\n\n(2) This is a logic gap that many people fall afoul of: we consider the potential risks and the unknown factors as a cost of **intervention**.\n\nWe very often fail to consider the cost of **non-intervention.** Untreated ADHD is so often misdiagnosed as depression and anxiety, even bipolar (though that is a genuinely tricky one to untangle for clinicians), and a lot of that is due to the consequences of living with ADHD in a world that does not cut you any slack and does not forgive the symptoms of ADHD.\n\nOf course we get depressed, and of course there are self-esteem issues, and of course we develop anxiety around any number of things that have caused us pain in the past.\n\nTreating the ADHD medically will not resolve those concerns for everyone (I also have complex PTSD and the depression is associated with that), but for many people, it really does.\n\nBeing able to suddenly do the things we could never do — like task switching, sticking to plans, focus on things for more than 5 dang minutes, *actually deciding to do things and then doing them* — resolves so much of this.\n\nIt’s literally life changing.\n\nThe cost of non-intervention is almost boundless: job losses, huge debt, devastated relationships, social isolation, severe addiction and so on. That varies with severity of symptoms along different axes and also with how people develop non-medical coping and masking mechanisms, but it’s godawful.\n\nAnd if people are concerned about addiction, it’s worth mentioning how damn often we forget to take our meds or get a script filled! Also: stimulant medications for ADHD folk actually *prevent* addictive behaviours by addressing our need to generate dopamine before we start chasing it with alcohol, gambling, non-stop gaming, etc.\n\nWe can experience come down crashes and withdrawal if we mess up the timing, but not everyone does, and we do need to develop strategies for that (pro tip: you may be a rapid metabolizer and find you have to ramp up the dosage pretty quick; that doesn’t mean your addicted, it means your liver is a wizard).\n\nMedication is amazing. It’s not a magic bullet. We do need to unlearn a bunch of long term cognitive habits that we developed to get by. There are symptoms it’s not so effective for.\n\nBut damn… I didn’t know how much energy and thought I was spending talking myself down from overwhelming emotional spirals until I suddenly didn’t have to do that anywhere near as often."

No. But I’m functional, I can perform tasks that I am not capable of performing unmedicated no matter how much ‘therapy’ I have. \n\nOur brains literally work differently. Medication helps to bridge the gaps that we are missing. Taking it can be literally life changing. \n\nPeople don’t understand that when you have ADHD you’re not at risk of abusing these drugs, we aren’t doing them for fun, we are doing them for function. They are just medication, period. Add that to the fact that a lot of the things we struggle with, people just can’t comprehend struggling with them. They can’t understand when they can just DO the task or focus on the thing. Well just try harder! Surely you can do it on your own! See this is no problem! Just work at it.

With little to no side effects or draw backs, the only annoyance is having to get a prescription every month and having to coordonate my schedule around appointment and going to thr drug store, think ahead if I have to travel or go out of the city etc. Which is really nothing compared to the suffering of years of being untreated. \n\nI’m growing very tired of the idea that “natural” is better than “chemical”. When “natural” can be very dangerous and cause lot more damaged than chemicals, by which I mean: remaining untreated, misdiagnosis, unsuited therapy, or just a bad or unprofessional therapist (I’ve experienced re traumatization in the therapy several times due to a lack of trauma informed therapy and therapies in my country, and also unprofessional behavior and disrespect of boundaries. The trauma in question were things that were no longer bothering me and had nothing to do with why I came). As well as all the risks of new “alternative therapies” (that aren’t validated by the scientific community) being cults in disguised seeking to abuse vulnerable people. \n\nI’d really like to hear about the risks of such things more instead of constant meds bashing in the media by people who know nothing of ADHD (or what it’s like to live with a condition that is debiliating) and modern science. ADHD meds have been prescribed and studied for a couple of decades now, side effects are known, there are starting to be ways (like DNA testing I think?) to figure out which meds is likely to the best for you. Whereas for “natural” remedies the side effects are unpredictable and will very specific to one’s particular context."

Because they do help, even while you're on the meds. \n\nBut here's the lengthy analogy.\n\nNo meds, no coping skills: being in a river without being able to swim. You are drowning. \n\nNo meds, learning coping skills: learning to swim. You aren't drowning, but it's exhausting and all you're doing is not drowning.\n\nNo meds, experience with coping skills and/or highly supportive family: congratulations you have a canoe! with a hole, and a broken paddle, darn, but at least there's a bucket. You can, with effort, progress and it even feels normal to put in that much effort. \n\nYou maybe don't even realize it isn't normal to have to stop and bail out the bottom of the canoe. Sometimes you try to go or turn too fast and flip the canoe. You fall out and have to get back in and bail and bail and you feel like a failure for the canoe flipping over. You cope with it by doing less because you're fine as long as you limit yourself. \n\nYou're getting down the river. You're functional.\n\nMeds, no coping skills: Speed boat. Only the steering wheel is a little big.\n\nMeds and coping skills: and now you can steer properly."

You have a certain number of spoons depending on the day, and you need to budget your spoons on important things to you. \n\nInternal monologue/internal chatter is only my current thoughts, feelings, etc rather than every thought ever. \n\nSome of the stimulants were/are abused by neurotypicals. Neurotypicals/ADHD people experience the medication completely differently because of different brain chemistry. My personal take is that difference and the history of some medication creates that stigma. \n\nI feel like a ADHD simulator with and without meds would clarify so much. \n\nWhen advocating for myself, it helps to think about it in the context of a non- stigmatized illness. \n\nExample: School accommodations are like making sure there is a wheelchair ramp. No one would tell someone needing a wheelchair to just try harder at stairs!\n\nHope this helps!"

It is also that if the psychiatrist knows this information and just irrationally deletes it out for some ethical reason, they would not tell the patient this info and instead opt for you to get an ADHD coach, a planner, etc.. These do work, but in conjunction with stimulants. The general consensus currently (it may change) is that stimulants alone are more effective than any other alternative treatment programs even though a combined form is recommended. It is very different from prescribing antidepressants where it's a last-course deal.  \n\n\nUnfortunately, if you live in a conservative culture (country, city, region), they will likely tell you no meds, not just for ADHD, but for generally any mental illness or difficulty."

The habits built while on meds didn’t just disappear, which is really awesome."

They made me unable to feel emotions other than anxiety, anger, sadness, etc. No \"positive\" emotions. When I finally stopped taking them, I felt so alive! And now that I'm seeking treatment once more because I can't fucking function, the only solutions we have is still to just take amphetamines? Fuck! I hate it! I don't want to feel like a zombie again. I want to be emotional and creative and unrepressed, but still be able to function. Why the fuck is that so much to ask? I have to force myself to fit into this toxic culture? Does no one see how messed up that is?\n\nI hate how if I speak negatively at all about meds on here, I get downvoted to oblivion and told that I'm being a problem. You guys should understand! Didn't you have to take the damned stuff when you were kids and hate how they made you feel? Ritalin, concerta, Vyvanse, we tried so many! They all made me feel like a zombie. My little brother said he felt like a statue, and I have no idea what that means, but I also understand exactly what he means. You can't be yourself. You're repressed for the sake of fitting into an ableist society and I for one find it disgusting. I wish society would just give us accomodations instead of expecting us to negatively affect ourselves to comply with their demands."

I think it’s because the same people who seek out a safe place to find help/support or to discuss/vent about adhd are the same ones who are more likely to be affected by the symptoms to a greater extent in one way or another. If you were able to live a relatively “normal” life there would be little reason to seek out a group like this. Like any mental illness or learning disability they exist on a spectrum if that spectrum was a 0-100 scale people say below 35 are less likely to need the medication to exist in a productive manner than those over the 35 mark. Those are completely random numbers btw just used them for the example. Or someone who has a particular symptom the impacts themselves so negatively that their quality of life is incredibly low. \n\nA good analogy would be if you sprain your ankle you may not take ibuiprofen because it’s not that bad and you can work with the pain and won’t need to seek out a doctor, but if you break your ankle you’ll need to take pain meds to at least alleviate the swelling (as well as surgery) and need to go to a doctor."

Ritalin, adderall, and other stimulants get such a bad rap because neurotypical people get cocaine-like highs from them and act all cracked out. Meanwhile, I’m taking adderall, Wellbutrin, too much caffeine, no one would ever know I’m on meds and I and could nap after a busy day. Different medications affect people differently, too. If I had only tried Methylphenidate (Ritalin), I’d think, “Ugh meds are awful, I felt like a zombie and just wanted to nap all day.” Meanwhile, Adderall XR helps me focus, get through the day without running around in circles too much (I literally logged 28k steps and had to stay at work 3 hours later on a day I ran out) and *functional*. I can’t develop coping mechanisms without adderall helping me actually be capable of doing things in the first place. How can I figure out the best system to get through the work day if I can’t get an interview or get through an interview or show up to work on time? It’s like with antidepressants, it would be great if you could start working out and eating right and doing all of the little things to help you feel less depressed when you’re in the middle of a depressive episode, but you don’t have the motivation to eat or shower or even get out of bed, how are you going to go for a long walk outside and cook yourself a well-balanced meal? \n\nSorry for rambling, my work shift starts at 10:30am, so I haven’t taken my pill yet and it probably shows.

Like, I can schedule all the therapy appointments I want, but if I'm not on my meds, there's only about a 60% chance that I'll actually make it to a given one.

Granted, valuable lessons learned, but learned the hard way and at a high cost.

ADHD is not one of those. I have not seen anyone be successful off of their meds with severe ADHD. I strongly urge you to try medication.\" \n\nAnd he's right! Your brain is quite literally developed differently and if you want to function well in this world, you do need to be medicated or you need to be a master at managing it. \n\nI'm sure there are a few people who can manage without meds, but why would you want to if everything is so much harder without them? For some people meds just don't work and I think that self-management methods will definitely help them, but if meds do work and you can afford them, take life off of hard mode. \n\n\nAnd then there are all of those people that yap about \"they're drugging our kids!\" or \"it's legal meth!\" or \"meds just dull your emotions!\" but they're usually stupid, anti-science, and do not have ADHD, so...."

You are in a situation where your symptoms do not degrade your quality of life and there is no foreseeable end to that situation. (Extremely hard to come by.)\n\n2. You live somewhere such as the US, where you may get used to having the medications and managing your symptoms that way, but there is a high chance you will suddenly lose access because of factors beyond your control.\n\n3. You plan to go off-grid and will have less likelihood of symptoms degrading life quality, and less frequent access to long-term Healthcare of any kind.  (See point 1.)\n\n4. You are allergic.

Can’t be still, racing thoughts, agitation, impulsiveness. I need to be on medication. \n\nMy kids on the other hand are still growing and have also been diagnosed with ADHD, but I will not be putting them on medication because they’re in a pretty good environment with therapy and we’ve created a safe environment for them to live and go to school. They’ve not complained they’re still having issues, so I’m following their lead on how they feel and interact w the world. \n\nAny changes and I will for sure w their doctor put them on meds, but as of now, they’re doing well. It’s expensive, but my kiddos are not going to end up like me when I was struggling to become an adult. It was hell, so yes I need to be taking something. If they start getting worse as they get older then I have no qualms w it because their grown and their brains have had time to mature.

    "comment": "Honestly, I think that it's because people who don't know much about ADHD just see the medication as a dangerous drug that may or may not help something in your head. So if you are a person who knows more about street drugs than ADHD, you might think that it's just taking amphetemines for no reason.\n\nFor people who know more about ADHD but not enough about it, they view medication as optional since they don't know what it's like to have ADHD and are scared when they hear people saying that they \"need\" it.\n\nCompare this with schitzophrenia where it is incredibly inprecise and a lot of the medication is for medicating side effects. People would view you as a monster for advising someone to not take them.\n\nFinally, there are people who don't have ADHD, have not been diagnosed with ADHD, and who do not believe that they have ADHD, but buy Adderall in the streets because it \"makes you focus\" not unlike how meds for hypotension gives you better heart health (if you have hypotension and not increased blood pressure, like hypertension).\n\nTL;DR a lot of people just see the medication as sketchy street drugs that are prescribed for something in your head that you could deal with by being more focused and calming down more instead of a medication that almost all people with ADHD need to function. The ones who don't have mild ADHD and were raised with really great systems for managing them."

And then when I finally did all of those things and I was still self harming and still tried to off myself a few times. She doesn't believe that that year where I was doing everything was a bad year. \n\nEventually I got to a slightly more stable place. I wasn't hurting myself and I was going to continue to live, but I was still having suicidal ideations every day. I couldn't focus on work. I could barely function. I dropped out of college (it was a bad college anyway, 0/10). Life overall wasn't getting better. \n\nBut after I moved out and I could start getting medicated, I had hope that I didn't have to live that way. That helped. It took three years to find the right one, but I finally found a good pair of meds and I'm doing amazing. I have spent most of my time *not* depressed instead of depressed. I can think more clearly, I'm present in my body instead of dissociating 99.3% of the time. It only took three years because I had my mom's voice in my subconscious opposing medication. \n\nAlso being more grounded has made me realise I'm *WAY* more autistic than I thought. Dissociation had also lead to a thick layer of passive masking for many many years which made all the other issues worse. Now the passive masks fell off and I'm back to trying to figure out how to human. I feel like an alien in an unfamiliar body. But it's so worth it! \n\nIt is better to live without constant pain than it is to learn how to cope with constant pain. \n\nTL;DR: My mom is very anti medication so my life sucked no matter what I did for as long as I can remember.

But my argument was always if it will help him succeed in school and in life then what’s the problem? It doesn’t change anything except his appetite, so I did what was best for him. No apologies, no shame. You do what you feel you need to do to be happy and successful!\nAlso his doctors told me it is no different than someone with a heart problem, or diabetes who take medications, and I thought that was a very good point."

You don’t really get any extra benefits that other people don’t have, but suddenly everything isn’t blurry anymore. But taking meds when you don’t need them is like putting on someone else’s glasses - you’d never assume that your experience wearing their glasses matches what they see when wearing them, and you wouldn’t judge their effectiveness for that person based on how well you can see in them because they’re not your glasses and they weren’t made for your eyes.

The feeling of *validation* I got when she told me I wasn’t a shitty human, nothing was wrong with me, I was just wired differently was so huge. Nobody had every told me that I WAS good enough before.

I mean the difference between the two is **huge** in terms of how long it takes them to metabolize, it’s like a 24 hours *at least* for methamphetamine and an about nine for amphetamine.. Big big difference if you ask me and this has been the easiest way for me to explain it to people.\n\nEdit: for anyone *considering* pyrovalerones (pardon my spelling error) or cathinones just know that there are serious risks involved regarding psychosis with those in particular and medications like adderal have *DECADES* of research behind them, in fact most substances do, and adderal has shown the best results for **DECADES**.\n\nEdit 2: adderal as well can lead to psychosis if abused, fyi\n\nEdit 3: I’m specifically talking about self medicating and the risks of running it alone without a doctor or accurate information. I think I also should’ve pointed out that the biggest risk would be if you have a prior history of schizophrenia or if it runs in your family, or if you have a history of drug abuse. **However**, while I know this sub isn’t about addiction or abuse, once I started actual treatment (adderal) it pretty much stopped my issues in their tracks (I’m mostly just a big pothead, but now I don’t have any real desire for it in the morning like I used to, so that’s neat!), however no doctor would’ve helped me if they knew this about me… at least I’m pretty sure…"

I was high-performing, double major in 4 years at a top 10 university, then almost 9 years as a helicopter pilot in the Navy.  The only way I survived was developing lots of defense mechanisms, mental habits and strategies, and often just sheer willpower.  Every day was non-stop misery.  I had imposter syndrome the whole time, and I was constantly having to execute huge last-minute saves to survive.\n\nI finally got diagnosed and when I got out of the Navy, said enough is enough and sought treatment.  First hour on Ritalin was a game changer and I've been on meds ever since.\n\nBut if I forget to take them before I go to work?  All of those mental habits, and driving myself forward through a combination of willpower, self-hatred, and pain?  That's gone.  So any day off my meds is always worse than any day I ever had before I took meds.  I've gone a few weeks, and it always improves a little, but since I know now that I don't have to torture myself just to live, I don't know if I could go back to my old ways, which were unsustainable for my mental and physical health."

So I don't take time to self reflect or it would be another thing I pick up and then get bored with and stop.

Additionally there's other medications that don't affect blood pressure, such as Strattera and Wellbutrin.\n\nBut your first doctor did have an initial point, when you first start ADHD meds, the first thing your brain does is realize just how f***** up you've been for your entire life, and the first thing you do is try to figure out how to get it straight, and it's extremely overwhelming, and extremely stressful. That alone can cause your blood pressure to spike, but when you add high strength amphetamines on top of that, you're asking for a stroke. And I know this first hand, my blood pressure over the past couple of weeks with my new job has been over 180 over 80. It's to the point where I'm getting nasty headaches just from the blood pressure, all of my veins are popping, and it may just be due to the sheer amount of muscle gain that I'm getting working a intensive job, but that still doesn't change the fact that everything compounds when you have all of that stress.\n\nI'm glad you got everything sorted out without complications, congratulations.\n\nEdit: blood pressure, not blood sugar."

I explained that whilst im not typically creative, it actually allowed me to have more motivation to pursue the creative thoughts that do pop up instead off feeling too unmotivated to follow through with them.\n\nI have also since learned that if that sort of loss of creativity etc happens that it may just be the wrong medication for you. So yeah other people will always give their two cents and I think a lot of people see it from a political sense of the big pharma corporations just trying to fit us into some capitalistic mould and have us addicted to something that will make them money. \n\nWhilst I have some of those political beliefs around some things, I definitely think that those without ADHD often believe it is just an over diagnosed disorder and they just slap it on those society believes are hyperactive or disruptive or don't fit into the typical mould so let's just drug them up.

It come in 5mg tablets. \n\nAnd while it is more potent and does last longer, it actually has *fewer* side effects, and is generally regarded to be one of the best stimulant medications out there by people who are lucky enough to have taken it. \n\nIn oral doses under 60mg, amphetamine and methamphetamine really aren't that different in their effects. It's the doses that are taken with illicit methamphetamine that cause the problems people are so worried about. \n\nWhile methamphetamine abuse is certainly nothing to take lightly, the drug has a massive stigma that in all honesty is not entirely deserved, especially when taken as prescribed - very similarly to fentanyl."

I’d still take this over aimlessly failing at everything my entire life.  I’ve had some acquaintances that happen to know what meds I’m on try to tell me what’s good for me and what isn’t, meanwhile they’re usually abusing some other medications while I truly take my medicine as prescribed 90 % of the time.  \n\nMy point is that I stopped caring what other people’s opinions are about my medication, I have tangible self studies in before and after effects of being on and off these meds and I decided a few years ago that my best quality of life comes from the way I do things , so thanks for their “concerns” , usually borne out of their own guilt and not really concern for my own health (otherwise they might be more open to my explanations), but I know what’s best for me at this point, my physical health has gotten overwhelming better in the last few years, my blood work is all right where it should be, my weight is right where it should be, my mind is right where it needs to be, and there’s no one that can convince me otherwise.\n\nIronically my parents recognized the validity of my argument years ago and they’re supportive and it never even gets brought up.

So I decided to try to focus on the cars because that has always been one of my biggest worries. And, oh wonder, it worked.

    "comment": ">she said I couldn't possibly have it and be depressed as well.\n\nTo me, that's just completely idiotic, and I'm genuinely sorry you had to go through that process.\n\nFor me, I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression about a month before beginning to seek diagnosis a 2nd time (wooooo, go CAMHS.....), and got diagnosed 2 months after that (July this year, age 20). I went through psychiatry UK as a NHS patient luckily, as they're much faster than my local service, and booking system allowed me to move my appointment foreward by 2 months when there was an opening. \n\nSince beginning to re-seek diagnosis, it's been so clear to me that my depression has been directly caused by my ADHD, either directly due to emotional dysregulation, or indirectly due to the build up of guilt and shame and suicidal ideation that I had surrounding myself and my behaviour (to the extent that I ended up suspending my university studies due to effects executive dysfunction was having on my ability to keep up with university, and the effect that had on my mental health). Behaviour that I believed was all my fault and a personal failing, as I'd already been told I didn't have ADHD 19 months before actually being diagnosed, and that was something I'd accepted and believed.\n\nBecause of the circumstances surrounding university and mental health more generally, I was able to be fast tracked for titration, so I could be on medication before I went back to university. So I received first medication 3 weeks after diagnosis, instead of having to wait for 14 weeks on the waiting list.\n\nNow that I'm on the right medication (Elvanse/Vyvanse), I'm actually able to function at the level expected of me. Combined with my, presumably anxiety driven, always existing high expectations of myself and an inner need to do as well as possible (which used to always be completely contrary to my ability, affecting depression. gotta love double imposter syndrome), and living 20 years with an untreated disability (meaning I'm not taking this new ability lightly, or resting on my laurels), means that I'm currently very dedicated and driven, and seem to putting more effort than my peers. \nThis is especially true given that my symptoms have obviously not completely disappeared, so I still have to deal with things like going to bed at 4am last night, or 3am the night before, because of time blindness and continued difficulty with task switching/paralysis, and putting off leaving my desk and having a shower till 01:15, then a 'quick look at Reddit' turning into browsing for more than an hour, till 3am (as well as difficulty refocusing on work if I get distracted, like by watching YouTube videos for an hour). \nThe latter one having the consequence of not having time to buy food on the way to campus and inability to task switch to going to a shop once there meaning, with the exception of half a completely plain bread roll at 9am, not eating anything till 18:15.\n\n*In writing this, I've realised that I've gone off topic and presumably into far to much detail than necessary. I apologise for that. Whether ADHD related or not, I can get quite obsessive and compulsive with explanation and storytelling, out of a need for empathy and for others to fully understand me. Now that I've spent like 2 hours writing this all out, I feel that I can't just delete it all.*\n\n**In summary, besides as a consequence of emotional dysregulation, my depressive symptoms have been massively reduced since getting a diagnosis and starting pharmaceutical and psychosocial treatment. \nIt's insane to me that a psychiatrist wouldn't understand that ADHD and depression can be comorbid, particularly given that having ADHD increases likelihood for other SpLDs, and mental health conditions, the latter being especially so if diagnosis doesn't happen till adulthood, given the effect of ADHD behaviour not being recognised or able to be explained can have on childhood development.**"

But even without the perfect med, I’ve found that sometimes... it helps just to **stop trying to force the river**. Flow with it a bit.\n\nStructure doesn’t have to be rigid. Some days it’s a list.

Perhaps it has been a combination of Strattera and my therapy which I started around the same time which have helped.\n\nStrattera is the only med I've tried for ADHD (recently diagnosed at 35) and my side effects have been pretty minimal. The only thing that effects me now, and annoys me, is the increased heart rate. I have to say, also, that I see many people saying \"Meds were life changing\" or \"my mind was quiet for the first time ever\" and I have to say that is not particularly the case for me, but its different for everyone. \n\nThe results were subtle and slow and noticeable after time. I thought perhaps it could be placebo at first, but my drive to do things now has been relatively consistent. I still struggle at times with executive dysfunction and I feel like I'm not perhaps where I want to be eventually, but I will keep trying it for now I suppose."

I stopped being hyper vigilant and my anxious thoughts were almost muted. I was able to stop impulsive behaviours such as binge eating. I also became more patient and less irritated.\n\nSide effects were particularly uncomfortable but manageable imo for the first 3 days. In the first 3 days I sweated a lot, had dry mouth, insomnia and also nausea.\n\nOn strattera, I no longer find coffee enjoyable and my caffeine intake has been cut down drastically. This came as a huge surprise as I used to have 3 to 5 cups of black coffee every single day without fail for the past 15 years.\n\nAfter the 4th day, the side effects almost went away for me. But around this time the effects of the drug seemed to have reduced too. I read that the therapeutic dose is around 40mg to 80mg... Also that it takes some time to build up before effects are more noticeable. Fingers crossed, I shall see an improvement soon.\n\nTake it with food to prevent nausea. I take mine at night before bed. I also try to take some more magnesium to help with sleep and muscle relaxation."

    "comment": "You are overdosed. Are you getting any of your adhd symptoms relieved? If not, you are on the wrong drug. Strattera is one of the least effective medications for most folks, but it works great for some. Strattera also requires a full month of titration between doses, so if you only just started taking it, either ask your doctor to maybe lower it or just push through and see if the side effects don't go away.\n\nAlso consider other nonstimulant drugs (assuming you have a reason for not wanting stimulants if you're on Strattera) like wellbutrin or qelbree. Qelbree is a new, honestly much more impressive nonstimulant drug that doesn't have the same titration period. Or supplementing a lower dose of your adhd medication with a low dose of clonidine or guanfacine (both are in the DSM and approved to reduce sensory sensitivity as well as lower treatment thresholdz reducing the amount of medication you need to get to the same therapeutic effect. My psychiatrist is an adult adhd expert and says he has nearly every patient on one of them as a part of their treatment.\n\nHave you tried every stimulant? Desoxyn? Dexmethylphenidate? Amphetamine? Dextroamphetamine? There are also different metabolic delivery mechanisms for the same drugs. Essentially they all hit a different part of your prefrontal Cortex, so it's important to try each medication and give it a shot, as one of them is all but certain to hit the part of your brain that is deficient. You usually go through each drug's immediate release form for 2—4 weeks and see what happens, then find the right dose, then if you find the one that works and how much you need, switching to the long acting with sometimes a short acting dose later in the day.\n\nStrattera is known for its gnarly side effects. It's a last line med for a reason. I'd go back to exhausting all your options stimulant wise, try qelbree as a nonstimulant option, and ask about starting clonidine with them all.\n\nAnd yes, antidepressants are well known to not work well with adhd, worsening symptoms and causing side effects."

I also take Modafanil in the morning which is a stimulant but not amphetamine based, it’s really just for keeping me awake as I have suddenly developed random sleep attacks, but I find it helps my focus and concentration as well. \n\nSo that’s my ADHD ritual medication wise and I couldn’t live without it. I want to up the Strattera even further maybe to 80 or 100 would be ideal."

I knew about this going in, and Strattera was a life changing medication for me, so I was determined to make it through. For me, the tiredness only lasted a week or two. I would get extreme hot flashes within a few hours of my dose, and yes, horrible heartburn. It took the full 3 months for the heartburn to go away. Looking back, I should have been taking Nexium or Prilosec 30 min prior to the Strattera. It may not go away completely, but it should help. If you think the Strattera is worth it for you, try and push through! Also search other posts and comments, they’re helpful. Good luck!"

I was started at 40mg to check tolerance for 2 weeks and just went up to 80mg—the target for therapeutic dose for most people. Real benefits aren’t supposed to show up till 4-6 weeks later. I’m still just 24 days into it so far. \n\nI tend to feel some paradoxical effects a few hours after taking the medicine: working memory is worse, more impulsive, jittery. However when that wears off, about 5 hours after taking it, I’m starting to get zen, focus, and smooth energy. Not super convenient when you get the zoomies late at night.\n\nThe key is to stick it out all the side effects so far are slightly less each day with more clarity and calm."

My brain's less noisy, but ideas still pop into my head when I want to think about something. I don't feel less cognitively sharp.\n\nI feel less funny when I'm alone, but not when I'm around others. \n\nFrankly, I don't find the experience particularly profound. But it does help with executive function in ways that I can see. \n\nCombining low-doses of stimulant and non-stimulant meds isn't that uncommon. Obviously, not something you should do without consultation. I'd probably look into it if the legal requirements for stimulant meds in my state were less onerous."

I liked Strattera because I felt it helped a lot with my inattentive issues in comparison to stimulants.\n\nTake it at night on a Friday or the weekend; the side effects are super hot-or-cold, so some people report insomnia while other people report it makes them more exhausted. Either way, you'll have the weekend to recover and find a better schedule. It's also known to cause some pretty awful nausea, and some people report that taking it with food is better. \n\nIt takes roughly two to three weeks to build up enough in your system to take effect, so be patient.

When I got on it I didn't have any serious side effects aside from sleep issues (I had super light sleep no matter how long I slept. Magically went away 2 weeks in) but aside from tiredness didn't affect me greatly in any sense. YMMV though as ADHD meds as a whole don't work the same for everyone."

She actually takes it in tandem with a stim in the morning on school days, but on weekends or all of summer it's only the straterra at night. She unfortunately has very severe adHd. Emphasis on the hyperactive part just like me. So stims are necessary for her and I. But in individuals who are higher functioning and can focus somewhat and simply need a boost, then non stims can be just as good, such as straterra. \n\nSo in your case I would say straterra is a great start but definitely be open to stims in the future if you need to increase your dose and still don't feel enough effect. I think medication anxiety gets the best of us who are already more prone to anxiety to begin with.  They seem scary and I was scared to take even 5mg to start like i mentioned, but the difference was night and day. And I finally had the \"willpower\""

My public speaking and social anxiety has been helped quite a bit. \nI’d say the most notable change is just that my head is less “noisy.” \n\nI think motivation is the one thing I’d like more improvement with. I’m GREAT at avoiding things I don’t get some kind of enjoyment out of or can justify putting off. Particularly physical activity."

    "comment": "It hasn't sorted out everything for me, but I don't think one medication will.  I was on Elvanse (Vyvanse) initially which really helped with focus, but made my sleep even worse than normal.  Poor sleep has always been on of my big problems.  Focus isn't as immediately good on Atomoxetine but it has improved a bit.  I'm hoping the better sleep continues and I'm interested to see how things develop.  I am also on Pregablin for anxiety which seems to be very effective, not sure if I will have to stay on that long term or not.  Having been recently diagnosed (ADHD inattentive) at the age of 61 it does put a lot of things in perspective, the past does make a lot more sense.  \n\nGive yourself time for things to change I'm sure you will get there."

    "comment": "That's an insane amount. No wonder you're tired. Take less and you wouldn't feel tired. Are you even prescribed 100mg to take in a whole day??\nIt doesnt work that way with adhd. More you take, more calming and want to sleep, for me anyway. Depending on type and brain obviously. Its so individualised. \nUsually above 80mg is not recommended for adults daily. \n\nToo much brain stimulation can make you very tired and drained. You probably need to lower it for a while or have a long break.\n\nFor me:\nLess is more stability and less impulsive \nMore is sleepy time \nOver doing it is just pure abuse"

I started last september on Medikinet XL 20mg once daily,, but increased another 20mg at noon as it wasn't lasting that much, due to sleep problem and need for flexible dosing as I worked shifts in healthcare so here I'm  on Ritalin which worked well until last month when I woke up one morning, took 30mg layed in bed and slept for5hrs straight."

    "comment": "Wellbutrin changed my life.  A doctor put me on it 10 years ago to treat depression/anxiety. I never felt therapy was for me because I don’t feel like I have any more significant trauma than anyone else. I figured it was just a body chemistry/ hormone thing that the Wellbutrin treated. \n\nMy psychiatrist figures that my depression and anxiety were likely due to the feelings of frustration and failure that come with adhd.  And the Wellbutrin helped with the adhd.  Now I’m on Wellbutrin xl  and adderall (baby dose. 10mg ER in the morning 5-10mg IR in the afternoon) and things are great.  \n\nThere’s no harm in trying the Wellbutrin.  If it works, fantastic. If it doesn’t well you’ll just be where you are now."
