    "comment": "(Edit Update: I've actually been taking generic Mydayis, so all my info is for the generic.)\n\nI‚Äôve been on Mydayis for about a month, and it‚Äôs the third ADHD medication I‚Äôve tried. I‚Äôll lay out my experiences.\n\n**Ritalin IR** = Too intense. Was prescribed to treat hypersomnia, and yes, it succeeded in keeping me awake, but the hyperfocus was‚Ä¶ a lot. It completely killed my appetite while in effect, which was bad for me, and I would occasionally get painful muscle tension.\n\n**Vyvanse** = Useless. Had the same effect as a cup or two of coffee, except that it also had painful muscle tension. Took it once and never again.\n\n**Mydayis** = The best so far. Noticeable improvement in energy and focus but without the hyperfocus. There‚Äôs still some muscle tension, but not as bad as Ritalin or Vyvanse. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs an immediate release, and because it‚Äôs so long lasting I have to take it no later than 8am or it disrupts my sleep. I‚Äôve noticed it has a couple dips in effect during the day ‚Äì I guess when it‚Äôs switching between beads ‚Äì but overall it works well.\n\nRegarding food: I‚Äôve never been a breakfast fan, so I can‚Äôt say how it affects that, but Mydayis does affect lunch because it kills my hunger signals. I can still eat ‚Äì unlike with Ritalin ‚Äì but it makes me pickier and I have to be mindful not to wait until I feel hungry. Dinner is a mixed bag; if I skipped/didn‚Äôt eat enough lunch, I will definitely feel hungry by dinner. If I did eat lunch, then dinner is the same scenario as lunch (picky/not hungry).\n\n¬†I‚Äôm fortunate to have insurance that covers Mydayis, so I can‚Äôt speak to out-of-pocket cost."

And some non-stimulants as well.\n\nIm currently on Mydayis 50MG because no other med lasts long enough for me even at the highest dosages. I metabolize most medications faster than the average person.\n\nMy insurance (Anthem) who uses Express Scripts pays for my medication. They cover both brand and generic of Mydayis.\n\nBrand name at CVS is $90 and $55 at Walgreens. Generic is $30 at CVS and $15 at Walgreens.\n\nCash prices here (Fresno) is like $240 for Generic and $330 for Brand.\n\nAs for discounts for the drug, there aren't any from the manufacturers that i am aware of and alot of places won't even honor discount cards if you try to use them for controlled medications. I think Costco is usually the cheapest and that's without discounts."

    "comment": "Ehhhh I took Mydayis for about 3 months. I would definitely not recommend. It might work for some people but it has a lot of peaks and valleys that‚Äôre really different than vyvanse and it‚Äôs really annoying. I would have 30-45min windows of just NOTHING (super unfocused and ZERO energy super sleepy) between the next bead starting to work. I got more used to it as time passed but that didn‚Äôt change that 30-45min of no symptom relief.\n\nBc it‚Äôs just longer acting adderall XR, it doesn‚Äôt really feel too consistent, and also, it doesn‚Äôt even last 16 hours!!!!! I assume I might digest medication a lot faster or something but I took it around 6-7am it would take a solid 2 hours to notice anything (I could sort of notice it working at around 1 hour but it wasn‚Äôt enough to help with symptoms. Maybe you would like it being more gentle like that in the morning but it really just made my mornings a wreck) then it only lasted until 4pm!!! That is barely 10 hours so I would‚Äôve needed adderall ir booster anyways just like I did on vyvanse.\n\nThe schedule was like this:\nTake at 6am\nCould feel first bead start working 7:30am to ~10:30am\n~10:30-11:00am gap\nSecond bead 11:00am-1:30pm\n1:30-2pm gap \nThird bead 2pm-4 or 4:30pm\n\nThe second bead felt like 1.5 times stronger than the first and third beads and the third bead would sort of just fizzle out and not really work that much past 4 even though it still was doing something.\n\nDef no insomnia thought, but take this with a grain of salt if you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre a fast metabolizer. I assume tho if you‚Äôre getting bad afternoon vyvanse crashes like I did then Mydayis probably won‚Äôt last that much longer. I find it only lasts around 2 hours longer than vyvanse, but vyvanse is so much smoother for those first hours that you might as well just get an adderall booster for those last hours.\n\nAlso I failed out of two of my college classes last semester because of Mydayis.\n\nI‚Äôm back to taking vyvanse now, and I take that at 7am and it lasts until 1pm then I take an adderall ir booster twice a day in the afternoon (1pm) and evening (4 or 5pm)."

    "comment": "Hi there! I‚Äôve been on Mydayis (50 mg) for about a month and a half now. \n\nI was diagnosed with ADHD combined type about 4 years ago. Since then, I have tried Focalin XR 40 mg (with Focalin IR 10 mg boosters twice daily), Adderall XR (with Adderall IR 20 mg boosters once in the afternoon), and Vyvanse 70 mg with no booster. \n\nHaving tried all of those, I have to say I really enjoy Mydayis, however, it‚Äôs not without its faults. Like another poster pointed out, it takes FOREVER to take effect. I typically wake up around 4:30-5:45 am on the weekdays and I will legitimately be nodding off till about 8 am. I eventually brought this up to psychiatrist and he prescribed a baby dose of Adderall IR (5 mg) to take in the morning with the Mydayis. This has made a world of difference. It gets me through that morning slump while I‚Äôm waiting for the Mydayis to take effect. \n\nAside for the slow onset of action, I find it to be pretty consistent. It‚Äôs very subtle compared to compared to most other long-acting amphetamine-based stimulants I‚Äôve tried. There‚Äôs no feeling of speedinesses, no jitteriness, no insomnia, and my appetite is good. \n\nOne thing to note is that I do feel the ‚Äúrelease‚Äù of each bead, so to speak. I‚Äôll be at work, just getting things done, and a wave of energy will hit me. It quickly dissipates and turns into productive energy but it‚Äôs a bizarre feeling nonetheless. \n\nI don‚Äôt think this med is for everyone. I like it, it works for me. It‚Äôs kind of pricey, but for some reason my insurance pays for the entire cost and I have no copay which is sweet. Let me know if you have any specific Q‚Äôs!"

    "comment": "I‚Äôm currently on 37.5 Mydayis. For me it‚Äôs a lot more ‚Äúsmoother‚Äù than Vyvanse. (I Have not tried Adderall)\n\nVyvanse was a huge rush, which wasn‚Äôt bad till it began to wear off. Eating is a lot harder than I expect. More or so because I feel fine. Not thirsty nor hungry. So I have to be disciplined about eating. \n\nI typically only take it on my work days. 12 hour shifts. \n\nAll in all, it is very effective but side effect clearly vary. I take mine around 5:30am and it starts to wear off around 3-4pm. During the working period, I‚Äôm super focused and thoughts actually make sense. It has helped me a lot at work.\n\nThe downside is that it effects my home life. I don‚Äôt want to depend on Mydayis on my days off. But when I‚Äôm not taking it, I‚Äôm very lazy and exhausted. It seems like I‚Äôm recovering from not only work, but also the usage. I cannot really judge my sleeping problems because I‚Äôve always been able to sleep for 10+ hours at a time if I want to. \n\nAnyway for me‚Ä¶\n\nPros:\n\n-Does its job. \n-Focus and work improved dramatically. \n-Longer acting so no need for ‚Äúboosters‚Äù \n-Not an overwhelming rush compared to Vyvanse. \n-Not longer socially self conscious, more confident with my thoughts. \n-I actually stick to one task and WANT to finish it rather than procrastinating.\n\n\nCons: ( These can also be for ADHD stims)\n\n-The ‚Äúcome down‚Äù on off days. Irritability, lack of motivation, & exhaustion \n-Appetitive is a tough battle, but not unbearable. \n-It takes longer to metabolize and activate. ( 1 1/2- 2 hours) \n-$40 copay. Not really the biggest con, but may give you an idea of cost. \n-Once the ride has started, there is no going back. You have to be prepared for 10+ hours. \n- You cannot be an hours late taking it due to the active period. \n\n\nOverall, I do like Mydayis. It does as advertised. The side effects aren‚Äôt a deal breaker for me. My diet has been crap, so my off days may be a combination of my diet along with the ‚Äúwithdrawal‚Äù from the med. So it is part my fault. \n\nIt is a relatively newer drug for ADHD. If nothing else works, I‚Äôd recommend Mydayis. As long as you need the ‚Äú16 hour‚Äù active period. Be consistent with what time you take it. The last thing you want to do is miss your usual time of 7am and take it at 10am, which will most likely effect your sleep. \n\nGoodluck!"

Lots of people have serious issues with Strattera, but my wife has no issues with it what-so-ever other than a bit of drowsiness.\n\nI just recommend not giving up on a med before you and your doctor have decided to have you try it.

My work is suffering terribly, and I'm literally falling asleep during the day. I'm super anxious and depressed because I'm not getting anything done. \n\nI wake up around 4:30-5 just to take the pill and go back to sleep until 7 ( I used to wake up at 6 and feel fine). I don't feel anything until 9 usually and, if it kicks in, I suddenly feel calm and emotionless. Still very unmotivated, and can't get myself to do anything. By noon, I'm falling asleep.

It worked but it felt like it took forever to kick in (I came to find out Teva only coats the ER beads with medication and doesn‚Äôt actually have an IR bead). Then my pharmacy gave me the SpecGX and I personally felt a huge difference. SpecGX worked a lot quicker and the motivation and focus were better on it than Teva. SpecGX also is more like the name brand since they use 3 beads rather than 2 like Teva. Everyone reacts differently though, so even though I didn‚Äôt like Teva it might work for you. There‚Äôs also a Sun Pharma generic that uses 3 beads, but I have not tried that one. I was able to have my doctor put a note on my prescriptions that says not to dispense me the Teva generic, so it might be worth a shot to ask your doctor to do this for SpecGX."

And let me tell you its like a you asking a baker for the recipe of a cake and they say \"butter, flour, sugar, milk\" and how they kinda topped it. Thats it. So no ratios, types of ingredients. Like salted or unsalted butter? What type of milk, flour, sugar? How much of each. The time or temp? None of that.¬†\n\n\nI did alot of research research and figured whats going on not 100% but 75%\n\n\nMydayis uses a specific 3 bead mechanism that isnt able to be copied\nThe active ingredient in mydayis create a 3:1 dextro levo formula that also doesn't have the ad formulations that xr uses. Thus its a single mixed salt combo with only having dextro levo. A dextro, c dextro and A levo, c levo. (Like salt, sugar, acid, sulfur)\n\n\nMydayis generics only get the general formulation patent being\nThe basis of the active ingredients there are(like butter, milk, flour, sugar) and that it has 3 bead mechanism\n\n\n\n\nWhile technically 8 types of amphetamine(4 being just called dextro and 4 just called amphetamine)while not knowing if its salt, sugar, sulfate or adic type(not what theyre actually called but for latenant terms). If those each are of a single hydrate or not.and mydayis uses 4 very specific ones. With a specific ratio, and with a very specific bead formulation.\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion why is what we have even allowed to be called a generic?! Like I knew that it wasn't the same active ingredients or beads or amounts. But the generics have no actual formulation. Its not mydayis.

And was just so tired. Vyvanse is a 100% dextroamphetamine medication. With an er mecanism and the dextroamphetamine isnt in its true form its metabolized into dextroamphetamine instead of being the ready available ingredient. Mydayis is amazing for me bc it lasts long doesn't have those dips that ir adderall has. Also its a 3 to 1 ratio which is amazing for me bc as adhd inhibit the frontal cortex. Wich dextro is great for, I also need a tiny bit of levo for that energy."

    "comment": "Its actually formulated to have no dips so you dont feel the next 2 releases. And they are specifically formulated to gradually wear off. They use to have a bunch of data and they had published their data and the vague outline of how they formulated it compare to adderall xr, and adderrall ir, and even how it worked different than even combining xr and ir. Since shire is the creator of both they have all that info and even many generic adderralls xr/ir aren't made like the brand name. The amounts are allowed to be off by like 20% and the ratios are allowed to be off too. Its really crazy. Thats also why teva had the closest generic to shire. Because shire is like the parent company of teva. (Kinda like its aunt). Maybe you metabolized mydayis faster? Mydayis beads and ingredients are ph and fat soluble. Just a guess though. Or even it could be that you just need a different ratio of dextro to¬† amphetamine?"

Currently I‚Äôm on 37.5 mg with instant release Adderall for days I don‚Äôt take it.\n\nFor me it feels similar to Adderall XR + IR booster, but smoother. I struggled with remembering to take the booster dose; more often than not, I found myself in an afternoon slump realizing my meds had worn off and that I‚Äôd been spinning my wheels for the past hour. \n\nWith the triple release of Mydayis I really need to be on top of nutrition and hydration. It works best when I eat a solid breakfast beforehand and a full lunch. If I don‚Äôt, I struggle to catch up throughout the day then end up feeling foggy, unfocused, and physically off. A heavy carb meal the night before also helps.  In contrast, when I took Adderall XR I‚Äôd sometimes feel it wearing off a bit and would get hungry before I took the booster. Without that hunger cue, I really need to plan meals and snacks ahead of time. It works brilliantly when I‚Äôm properly fueled. I had a similar experience with appetite suppression on Vyvanse.\n\nI also sleep better with the long coverage."

My focus would vary wildly, and although I could handle things like writing or doing comedy in the evenings, my life was always kinda falling apart, especially if work was not in a good place.\n\nSince taking meds, my work day, my actual 9-5 is much more stable, and I've been in the same job for four years now which is nice.\n\nBut it does feel like I've traded away my free time and to an extent my creativity in exchange for stability. I'm somewhere between a bit numb and fully braindead in the evenings once the meds wear off, and I hate the sense that it is closing off parts of my life. \n\nMy resolution when I started meds and started to understand this was \"it's still worth it\". The pain, shame and stress I felt when my life was upended by losing a job was awful, and so to feel confident that's not about to happen again really big. \n\nI've even considered trying to stop meds to avoid the meds crash, but I suspect it's a grass is always greener thing, and if I stopped I'd just go back to wanting stability."

Doctor advised to take 20mg at noon so that i can get things done in the evening but I don‚Äôt usually take the added dose.\n\n2 months back I discovered that staying hydrated during the day and spending some time with friends in the evening boosts my ability to get things done in the evening.\n\nInstead of taking the 20mg added dose I try to go for a tea or snacks with couple of friends after work. On those days, I can maybe do the laundry or the dishes or maybe both or nothing. It depends on the day and it works for me cuz for some reason my mood is better and I don‚Äôt beat myself up on those days. \n\nI felt that I don‚Äôt beat myself up for not doing anything if i had spent some time out with friends. If there was nothing happening in the evening and if im not able to do my chores I‚Äôll instantly start beating myself up. \n\nI can tell myself that it‚Äôs okay to not do anything but it usually doesn‚Äôt work.

An hour before your workday ends, you might try planning a small task on your way home from work - getting gas, or picking up groceries - to help start transitioning your brain into non-work mode. Or plan to do something fun at home right upon your arrival. \n\nI time my last adderall dose late enough to take me through dinner, but not late enough to interfere with bedtime. You also might try an afternoon cup of coffee. I find caffeine gives me a different type of alertness than the meds."

Not even deadlines or fear of consequences can motivate me if I have no energy, unless they're really bad consequences that I know for sure I want to avoid later so I do the task now.\n\nRecently, I've been looking to improve how much energy I have for things. Medicine works well combined with enough sleep. Also, I used to always miss lunch but eating somewhere in a long day helps to give me a boost. Water, short breaks, variety in work also helps me get motivated and moving.\n\nFor the things that I'll forget, I often write them down somewhere I'll check semi-regularly. I'm hoping to create a habit of whenever I'm thinking I'm forgetting something, I can check that one place, like an app or notebook.\n\nI used to drain myself focusing only on work 9-5 then I realised since I hate my job, (atm lol) I should think of what I can get to do after I finish work. Like do all my favourite stuff; eat food, watch youtube, then do my hobbies or allocate time for those important adulting shit.\n\nListening to music or body doubling helps me get through the slog of doing tasks I put off too.

But that comes at a cost. It means we may never be socially recognized as 'successful', even if we have optimized our life for our goals and ideals. \n\nHope you are able to find things that make you come alive outside of work.

I also put every bill I could on autopay on my credit card so I only have to set a reminder to pay the one credit card bill every month (which has also drastically improved my credit score).

My insurance (United) works with Express Scripts, which means I can go every 3 months to my doctor, they send 3 x 30 day prescriptions electronically to Express Scripts, and the bottles just show up in my mailbox (well, at my door, I have to sign for them) on schedule, without me needing to do anything.

Shire has three patents relating to Mydayis. The one that expired May 2023 was purely for the dosing regime, allowing them to create pills in the same dosages. \n\nHOWEVER, the actual controlled dose release mechanism is still covered by their two other patents that don‚Äôt expire until May 2026 and August 2029. \n\nThe way Mydayis is delivered into your system (through the stomach and different parts of the intestines based on pH to trigger the releases) is ONLY utilized by the brand name itself. These ‚Äúgenerics‚Äù just had release profiles similar to Mydayis and worked long enough to be deemed equivalent. *So until the release systems patents expire, there isn‚Äôt a real generic of Mydayis.*"

I was only on 20mg, once a day but it caused horrible side effects for me. My whole body felt inflamed and when it would ware off, I was very moody. Like I'd be fine one minute, then really sad the next. The whole body inflammation was what ultimately made me stop. My Dr said it was like an allergic reaction. It didn't work that well for me anyways. I'm going to try Ritilan next, here's to finding something that works. ü§û"

Pharmacy is super busy and never answers their phone. So I‚Äôve been on a forced withdrawal - again, while seven months pregnant - because I had no idea it would take this long. Finally went today and the guy said they were sent a week ago by ‚Äúsnail mail‚Äù. They‚Äôre fucking sending drugs thru the mail OMFG. Had a great temp today who gave me a weeks dosage to get me back up while I wait but holy Christ.

I may have skimmed over it when reading about Vyvanse and forgotten about it because it's not a side effect I've experienced or been terribly afraid of (which is apparently not necessarily an ADHD thing, we remember info that's deemed important to our brains and the brain yeets the other stuff as it deems fit), but I'm not sure I've ever heard of that.

I didnt want to make a fool of myself so I was searching for the max daily dose information and it came up for children and adults. \n\n Vyvanse lasts the longest due to its protein binders. \nVyvanse has a 13 hour life, so that's just interesting.  I've been on stimulants for 30 years on and off and sometimes having the body reset off of stimulants is a good thing. We are both in the same boat though- I can't find any vyvanse around me and I am not sure what I am gonna do. I also suffer from narcolepsy so without stimulants I sleep 12 to 14 hours a day .

How long it takes to develop a tolerance really comes down to your individual brain chemistry, dosage, physical traits, etc. so some people will do fine on a low dose for many years, while others need to bump up the dosage quite quickly."

I think the big chain pharmacies are also saying \"out of stock\" when they have hit their number of meds they are allowed to dispense each month or however they parse that out. A newer law on controlled substances aimed at opoids has had a dramatic impact on stimulants as well. I could be wrong, but I think that also could be why it all feels so shady when the pharmacy says they are out and can't help you or even call another f-ing CVS for you."

How in the world a small government can go against recommendations from the entire fields of psychology and psychiatry/medicine is beyond me. If you had cancer, would they say we don't want your chemotherapy drug here, if you want to live, move elsewhere! Oh wait. That whole critical thinking thing.

My experience is only with generic Vyvanse and I recently went from 40 to 50mg. I didn't notice a huge difference tbh. I never got to try name brand and I've been struggling on generic, which seems to be doing little, if anything. Idk if it's worth it to bump it up another 10mg or just try something else. I'll take it around 8am and by 3pm whatever effects were there are gone. If it takes 2 hours to kick in, that gives me 5 hours of being medicated. I've gained 15lbs since being switched to generic Vyvanse, which is probably a sign it's not working because its other use is to treat binge eating. I've been more hungry (stomach actually growling) on generic than any other medication I've tried."

Mydayis is formulated for triple-release over a 16-18hr time period. My Doc prescribes it for patients that either need meds to last longer, or patients who have too many side effects on Adderall XR. Pronounced insomnia is a potential side effect though, doubly so if you happen to also be taking any GLP-1 meds.\n\nThat being said, Mydayis even in generic, is considerably more expensive than Adderall XR which can be a clue. How has the price of your script changed?\n\nWhich direction are they switching in, also? Are you supposed to be on Mydayis and being given Adderall XR? Or the other way around? The way your wrote it in your post is only partial info, both scripts would be accurately described that way but then have more after them to clarify.

I read the entire DEA summary of it in the Federal Register and what they explained is that the reason they did not up the quotas is that manufacturers did not meet last years quotas so it seemed presumptuous to increase it just based on the supply chain issues the manufacturers were experiencing. So it‚Äôs a two part problem‚Ä¶.not fixed by increasing quotas. \n\nI imagine there were a lot of underserved patients last year (I couldn‚Äôt get my meds in December) but that seems to be because the manufacturing/supply issues most of all. For me it‚Äôs TBD if the quotas need to be increased or not. So, I‚Äôm not blaming the DEA. Not saying they are doing a great job but I‚Äôm more pissed at bad supply chain management by Pharma."

    "medication": "Mydayis",

They‚Äôre most likely not upping the manufacturing allowances because a few of the several manufacturers of Adderall (both name and generic) still have stock available *on top of* not yet reaching their individual production limit. It‚Äôs why the shortage has been so very much location based so far, because different manufacturers generally supply different regions.\n\nYou can check the availability from different manufacturers [here](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/drugshortages/dsp_ActiveIngredientDetails.cfm?AI=Amphetamine%20Aspartate;%20Amphetamine%20Sulfate;%20Dextroamphetamine%20Saccharate;%20Dextroamphetamine%20Sulfate%20Tablets&st=c&tab=tabs-1#).

I‚Äôd say if you do well or better on vyvanse than adderral XR, it should be a solid fit. \n\nIf you‚Äôre paying straight out of pocket for it, then it‚Äôs about double the price of Adderall at my pharmacy, but still less than half the price of vyvanse out of pocket. \n\nTo me, the side effects are nearly identical but Dexedrine was a little smoother/less tweaking sensation than Adderrall. \n\nIt might be worth calling the pharmacy you go to or pharmacies in the area and asking if that‚Äôs better supplied than Adderall, if so, I‚Äôd mention giving it a shot to your psychiatrist and surely they‚Äôll write you a script."

Here is the same reply I made in the other thread:\n\nA couple thoughts:\n\n1) This article didn't seem to be as well researched as others I've read, which went into some detail about the supply chain and labor issues at Teva (the biggest generic Adderall manufacturer). Based on everything I've read, I am looking to March as the end of the shortage (though I'm sure this will be lumpy as new supplies roll out to remote areas)\n\n2) A *lot* of online pill mills that sprang up during Covid have closed, been shut down, or voluntarily stopped Dxing ADHD (or at least Rxing meds). I can't help but think that this represents the overwhelming majority of over-prescription, which would mean that despite the DEA's holding steady the production quotas for 2023, we should all have fewer issues this year.\n\n3) It would be prudent to stash some supply away for a rainy day, because unless all of the above goes perfectly, there will be another shortage at the end of the year. Start stockpiling now, if you can.  I try to set aside a small amount every week, if I have a day here and there where I don't need to be \"on\" for the whole day. No, this isn't possible for everyone but if it's possible for you, it would be foolish to walk into October with nothing saved."

After speaking with the guy for 10 min he quickly mentions again that he orders the generic and everytime he does the order never comes unlike the name brand‚Ä¶.and I say ‚Äúwait a minute, you have the name brand‚Äù.  He says ‚Äúyes that one comes in when we order but the generic doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù  I said ‚Äússoooooo, I can get the non-generic right now?‚Äù  He proceeds to tell me he can have it ready in 10 min.\n\nSo, be sure to ask your pharmacy if they have no-generic, it costs a few bucks more but if you depend on the medication to focus for work or school, it‚Äôs worth it."

The DEA AINT I repeat WILL NEVER up the amount of adderall to made. Its the fucking DEA. Like they give a shit about people who actually need this drug. The fact of the matter is this:\n\nIt's a DRUG. FUCKING PERIOD.\n\nYou wanna ask me?\n\nThis is all obviously on purpose. Wether you take adderall to theraputically treat your adhd or pop them to pass exams, the fact of the matter is, adhd meds make you feel good, work better, focus, accomplish tasks.\n\nThey dont give a fuck its still a DRUG. DRUG BAD. NO DRUGS FOR YOU. \n\nWhat I am trying to say is, the DEA doesnt give a shit that people need and its used to treat adhd. \n\nThe fact that its a drug is all that fucking matters.\n\nFucking pot is legal in like every god dam state now, why the fuck isnt adderall?\n\nCall me crazy, but i feel like some states should fight to make adderall fucking legal.\n\nTodays 14 days waiting for my god dam prescription to come in and im only making it through the days with fucking nos energy drinks\n\nI hate everyone"

DAY 3 - feeling fog brained, fatigue, can't focus nor concentrate while feeling anxious, sleepy & useless. I have a Dr appointment in about 3 hours to talk to my doctor about other possible alternatives. Can't afford to pay $288 a month, also, can't afford to miss work due to the numerous crash occurrences that comes with cutting yourself off after taking the medication at high dose for so long.

That‚Äôs why I always have to go into my doctor to get my prescription, and you especially can‚Äôt get diagnosed through TeleMed for those things. But they lifted that law during Covid cause they had to. And this fucking guy Kyle Robertson (CEO of Cerebral) Just started over prescribing everyone Adderall and other drugs for profit. I guess the DEA regulates the amount of Adderall that can be manufactured by the past year, like how many people purchased it through a doctor the year prior is about the number they allow for the next year, because it‚Äôs an amphetamine. But this guy pretty much doubled the usage. So now manufacturers are saying they literally don‚Äôt have enough ingredients to keep producing but the DEA won‚Äôt lift regulations because it‚Äôs amphetamine and this guy is getting sued by all of his previous coworkers, because apparently the entire time he was just promoting profit profit profit and not actually diagnosing or caring about people. And I guess he was also persuading doctors to increase dosage really quickly just like in that show on Hulu about the Oxy pandemic. So he pretty much screwed everyone who actually needs medication so he could profit off of it. \n\n https://www.instagram.com/p/CdQ8ZxJs5U_/?igshid=ZjE2NGZiNDQ= \n\nHere is an excerpt from the guardian article that was linked in the OG post if you want the full details. \n\n‚ÄúBut ex-employees say Robertson was only focused on profit. He saw a golden opportunity to prescribe ADHD stimulants online, and Cerebral‚Äôs pitch deck to investors contained a image of controlled substances next to the words ‚ÄúNow is the time to capture growth‚Äù, the Wall Street Journal reported.\nEx-employees allege that Robertson, who has no medical background, was pushing his hired nurse practitioners to prescribe stimulants to as many 30 new patients a day, in online evaluations that lasted as little as 10 minutes.\nThe gambit worked. Word spread quickly about Cerebral, and by late 2021 it had served more than 200,000 patients, had signed the gymnast Simone Biles as ‚Äúchief impact officer‚Äù, and was valued at an eye-popping $4.8bn‚Ä¶In March 2022, a group of former staff publicly accused Cerebral of fueling a new addiction crisis by pushing the drugs. Weeks later, the former Cerebral executive Matthew Truebe sued Robertson, alleging that the founder had ‚Äúdirected Cerebral employees find ways to prescribe stimulants to more ADHD patients to increase retention ‚Ä¶ egregiously [putting] profits and growth before patient safety‚Äù.\n\nFuckk this guy"

Was eventually totally out and called the local King Soopers (/Krogers? Idk grocery store). They picked up so fast and I asked about filling an Adderall script. He told he straight up that certain doses weren't being made anymore. So with my new doc went to the 10mg which is low, but. Filled it  the first time in early Nov easy. Since then....I can only rely on my lower than should be dose of Vyvanse (new doc won't up me from 40 mg though was at 100 or so healthily) but anyways.\n\nYeah.

Because according to what Ive read, the DEA didn‚Äôt give a reason for not increasing the amount of pills. \n\nFrom the article I linked in the OP:\n\n> Meanwhile, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which controls the supply of the drugs, announced last month that it would not increase manufacturing quotas for 2023, despite the shortage ‚Äì again, without providing a reason. One congresswoman, Abigail Spanberger, wrote to the DEA and FDA to demand an explanation last December, but Spanberger‚Äôs staff told the Guardian she had yet to receive a response.\n\nI agree with you in regards to the supply chain issue, but I have yet to be convinced that is the primary issue. It doesnt take 6 months to resupply meds just because one company couldn‚Äôt get decent workers last summer, which is the only supply issue Ive read about. This isn‚Äôt about the supply of the ingredients that actually make up the pills themselves. \n\nThen again, there doesnt have to be *one* primary problem. Its clear this is a few primary issues that happened to conjoin at a singular point in time. I guess the problem Im currently reading about is that the other issues have been resolved and yet the problem is still happening. Ergo the main current problem is the DEA, IMO."

I read the entire DEA summary of it in the Federal Register and what they explained is that the reason they did not up the quotas is that manufacturers did not meet last years quotas so it seemed presumptuous to increase it just based on the supply chain issues the manufacturers were experiencing.\n\nI read that too, and I also read that the DEA stated that it was already aware of patience experiencing difficulty and being unable to fill their prescription. There was also a jump in prescriptions for stimulants.\n\nSure, the supply chain needs to be better, But ultimately it's the dea's job to make sure people get their fucking meds. If the supply chain is having difficulties and isn't going to be able to keep up unless quotas are increased, you fucking increase the quota. They decided that they weren't going to do that, and the fact that they haven't done anything to alleviate the issue makes it seem like they don't really care.\n\nThis isn't a Viagra shortage, it's a shortage of medication people need to function and live their lives normally."

    "comment": "But all the brand drugs with less or no generics are not gonna suffer such manufacturing problems. It‚Äôs partially a case of generic manufacturers needing time to reverse engineer the formulas and submit ANDAs to FDA showing bioequivalence. Unfortunately, most manufacturing occurs off shore in a variety of countries with a variety of rules and customs - compliance with a US-only marketed drug might not be worth the penalties if they really can‚Äôt keep up on the stringent QA and QC AND diversion controls demanded. There weren‚Äôt in person plant inspections for years and now the FDA is showing up in India and Africa again to inspect n manufacturing plants. From a risk perspective, I‚Äôd just keep pumping out generic HBP meds and Lipitor and shit like that. That‚Äôs part of it. Then there is the part about our opioid crisis.  Pharmacists are being ordered not to fill prescriptions for CII drugs depending on physicians or other factors to avoid liability like when they‚Äôd throw oxy out like skittles. All major pharmacies are not incentivized to make zero bucks on stimulant generics, but even with exclusive brand names they now know they could be on the hook for filling people‚Äôs Rx‚Äôs without any protest. I think nobody needs to go out of their way to fix this problem except patients and providers. \n\nCompounding pharmacies and providers oughta grow a pair and step up here. Insurance will argue but guarantee they cover your compounded stimulant when your appeal documents their contracted network pharmacies simply don‚Äôt have the formulary drugs YOU are supposed to have as a benefit of paying THEM premiums. \n\nI say we all ask for Desoxyn, compounded if not generic. See what the standard of care does to providers who won‚Äôt even suggest it despite it not being mentioned as a shortage and is a perfectly reasonable 3rd line stimulant for ADHD. Provider has to prescribe something, fear of DEA isn‚Äôt valid excuse to choose no treatment to replace the 1st and second line drugs. Pharmaceutical companies make it in the USA and don‚Äôt have a quota problem. Desoxyn for all!"

I suspect it‚Äôs partly because psychiatrists are switching their Adderall pts over to Dex, but I also suspect the overall supply of Dexedrine is much lower as I have had issues with it being on back-order / unavailable at pharmacies across the mid-Atlantic since I first started taking it, i.e., way before all this shortage stuff, and while my friends on Adderall never had a single issue getting their Rx filled. If anything, it equipped me better to handle the shortage because I already knew what to do when the pharmacy just says ‚Äúno, sorry.‚Äù\n\nRe: the medication itself, I have heard people say Dex is smoother but I didn‚Äôt really notice a difference (I‚Äôve taken Adderall a few times).

However, I don‚Äôt think adderall should be legal outside of a prescription because it can be very addictive if you‚Äôre taking it without direction. \n\nThe only classic recreational drugs that I think should be federally legal are weed, shrooms, and LSD. Once those are under control then other drugs can start to be legalized because the health risks they pose are much greater than that of psychedelics. The only reason I say these 3 drugs are acceptable is because so far it‚Äôs historically impossible to overdose, and psychedelics aren‚Äôt stereotypically addictive like pharmaceuticals. Realistically anything pharmaceutical is going to be much more dangerous to legalize than anything psychedelic, just because of the sharp contrast in addiction potential that exists between the two types of drugs. \n\nAlso one more thing to keep in mind is the fact that coffee is the most addictive substance on the planet because of its accessibility. Now imagine if adderall was as legally available‚Ä¶it would be a complete shit show of addiction that‚Äôs 10x worse than the current caffeine addiction that everyone has."

Even if Teva wasn‚Äôt hit with the workforce issue, they were still projected to be well within their production limit.\n\nOther manufacturers *are* picking up the slack. My past two prescriptions were filled from two different manufacturers I‚Äôve never used before, meaning that the manufacturers are working with transportation companies to get their product to regions they normally wouldn‚Äôt supply to. Individual caps aren‚Äôt the issue when it‚Äôs projected that, even with the unfulfilled demand, we‚Äôre there no supply chain issues, *every manufacturer would still be within their production limit.*\n\nThe DEA is deciding caps based on manufacturing output last year *and* the demand this year.

The DEA has done a lot more harm than good, and taxpayer dollars would be better spent elsewhere, but this isn‚Äôt an issue caused by the DEA, nor is it one that the DEA can fix.\n\nYes, this is an issue isolated to the US. We‚Äôve been having supply chain issues since Covid. Large economies generally take *years* to get back up to speed after major economic slow downs. Major US ports still aren‚Äôt seeing the same volume of imports they did before the Plague, and there are multiple industries that are still suffering from this, not just adderall. Combine that with the increased demand due to relaxed Covid regulations and it‚Äôs no wonder manufacturers are having trouble meeting demand.\n\nIt‚Äôs not a very complicated issue, so I‚Äôm not sure exactly why news networks like the Guardian are trying to make it seem like some big mystery. I mean, the DEA actually *did* give an explanation as to why they weren‚Äôt increasing the limit, but ig the author of the article just glossed over it?

Global markets can easily take longer. Major US ports still aren‚Äôt seeing the same volume of imports they did before before Covid, which is causing supply issues for several different industries. \n\nIt doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be a normal shortage either, it could be artificial. Demand increased during Covid, and what once was adequate supply of raw materials may no longer be adequate given the demand increase. Add in how offshored labor typically isn‚Äôt the best at reacting quickly to market demands and you get both a ‚Äúshortage‚Äù of the raw materials and a manufacturing delay. Different companies offshore their labor to different countries, so different companies are having issues meeting demand in their regions while others are still chugging along just fine.

The limit isn‚Äôt the problem here. The DEA is responsible for a lot of harm, but the shortage *is not* their fault, nor is it something they can fix.\n\nThe reason it‚Äôs taking so long to catch up is because these companies offshored their labor, which makes their production costs cheaper at the cost of adaptability. Offshored labor takes longer to correct for changing demand, and these companies have historically only had to make smaller increases to their max production capabilities each year. Trying to increase production to make up for the few companies which have fallen behind (one of which I believe is the largest adderall supplier in the US) is a much larger correction then they‚Äôve historically had to do"

Over-prescription from online pill mills, for sure, combined with an unsympathetic DEA, is the proximal cause. But it's been exacerbated by both supply chain and labor / continuity issues. Additionally, there seems to be some legitimate dawning awareness of ADHD in our collective consciousness, and more people who would have just struggled for their lives are now seeking treatment. I am one of them. So there is some amount of legitimate new use, though absent any definitive new diagnostic criteria, it's impossible to tease that out from the fakers.\n\nSo closing the pill mills will only reduce demand by a portion of the total increase in the past 3 years, without regard to ongoing supply chain issues and labor issues, or the legitimate increased demand from patients who aren't just going away because they can't get legal speed online anymore. Coupled with an unbending DEA, it guarantees another shortage at the end of 2023 as the increased patient load bumps up against the unchanged supply constraints.\n\nSorry, I get wordy in Friday mornings :D"

Clearly that is a money grab as many people that depend on the medication will inevitably have to switch to the branded version since the generics aren't available.\n\nUltimately, it sounds like none of these parties are interested in taking any responsibility to address or even identify the problem.  If the problem is getting raw ingredients in thru US ports then why is nobody saying that.  The Guardian is spot on making it seem like a big mystery, because it *is* a big fucking mystery when none of the players claim to know what the actual problem is.\n\nBtw, it appears the shortage is worsening.  There have been quite a few new articles written about the shortage in the couple of weeks, like this Bloomberg article for example.  Also, I had to switch pharmacies months ago in order to get my generic IR Rx filled and now this pharmacy is out.\n\nEdit:\nBloomberg is behind a paywall, so here is another link to the same article:\n\n[https://www.ocregister.com/2023/02/16/adderalls-disappearing-act-has-left-millions-without-treatment/](https://www.ocregister.com/2023/02/16/adderalls-disappearing-act-has-left-millions-without-treatment/)"

It doesnt make sense to me that a pharmacy could be out of adderall for months when there‚Äôs some companies who have plenty of stock available.

The issue is that the manufacturers aren't making enough to hit the quota in the first place. \n\nTo make an analogy: if the government determines 100 units of wheat is sufficient to feed the population and sets a quota there, and farmers only produce 75 units of wheat so people are going hungry, being mad at the government for not raising the wheat quota is misguided because it has little if anything to do with the shortage. \n\nIf farmers then produce 100 units of wheat and people are *still* going hungry, that's strong evidence the quota (and critically, actual production) needs to be raised."

    "comment": "Availability of resources is, in this case, a smaller factor when trying to meet demand. Availability doesn‚Äôt mean much if the infrastructure to utilize the resources to the extent necessary isn‚Äôt available. For example, Africa is home to the largest known deposits of rare earth elements, but many of the countries there don‚Äôt have the resources to capitalize on this themselves. Outside corporations/governments are going in instead, and even they don‚Äôt have the resources/infrastructure in place to mine these elements to the extent necessary to meet demand.\n\nLocation matters because different manufacturers supply adderall to different regions of the US. Part of this is due to deals/contracts with transportation companies locking them into supplying only places said transport company ships to, and part of it is due increased to transportation costs the farther you go from distribution centers. So your local pharmacy can try to order from a different provider, but if they aren‚Äôt in that provider‚Äôs shipping range, that provider won‚Äôt ship to them. Some pharmacies also do make contracts with specific suppliers, but any chain pharmacy is most likely going to be supplied by at least two different suppliers.\n\nUnaffected suppliers in already stressed regions are now trying to compensate for others that have dropped the ball. I think the largest adderall supplier in the US was one of the companies having trouble meeting demands, so now other companies are trying to pick up the slack, which in turn spreads the shortage out to other regions. So yes, part of it is that they are trying to take on more than they can chew, which is delaying things for even more people. It‚Äôs like those woven rubber band bracelet things: stress in one band is going to be spread out to the others, which is why places like Arizona seem like they‚Äôre just barely getting hit with the shortage recently will other states have been dealing with this for months"

That means after our body processes it, it turns into another drug, in this case dextroamphetamine.  \n  \nNow the magical part is because the lis- part of the drug causes it to be absorbed by our body through a different path than normal -- and this difference causes the very consistent release mechanism."

Sometimes they will exclude newer drugs that are actually more effective and safer than older drugs just to save money.\n\nIf a medicine isn't covered, you can usually request an exception, but it requires having your doctor fill out paperwork to send in, and the insurance company will drag their feet making a decision, so it can take weeks. And they may still deny it. If they do grant an exception, it usually has an expiration date. So you might have to do this whole process every single year. I used to have to go through it for a medicine every year until my employer switched pharmacy benefit managers to one that has it on their formulary.

Some generics of priority drugs ‚Äì drugs that FDA‚Äôs CDER has determined are important to public health -- have been approved in six months or less. Other times, it may take several revisions to the application and several cycles of review before an application meets our rigorous approval standards.\n\nBecause of complexity, some generics are harder for applicants to develop and take longer for FDA to review. Examples include drugs that include a device, such as auto-injector pens; dermatological drugs that are administered on the skin; or drugs that are inhaled through the nose. Known as complex generics, these drugs require more complex research and data to ensure they are the same as the brand-name drug.

You should also let your doctor know as well as whoever manages your company‚Äôs health plan (ideally there is some confidentially you can broker before sharing details).  The day the system implodes and/or the payors and distributors are disintermediated in the relationship between drug development, healthcare services and a patients personal care management is the day we all win."

The difference between Mydayis and Adderall XR is how it releases in your system and length of time it lasts. Mydayis has  3-bead technology that releases amphetamine in the stomach and at points in the small intestine over several hours. It lasts up to 16 hours. I can vouch for me it lasted the full 16 hours. The three beads are different and release is triggered when they hit different parts of digestive system. \n\nAdderall XR never lasted for me long enough, I would have mood swings, outbursts like a toddler and high anxiety. It was like I would get lows and peaks in my mood and anxiety when Adderall released. Mydayis was smooth. I felt level all day and could focus. I never felt surges.

    "comment": "* Mydayis is the same active ingredient as Adderall and Adderall XR\n\n* Mydayis is made by the original maker of Adderall XR. (Shire) who also was the original maker of Adderall.  (More on this later.)\n\n* Mydayis uses a 3 bead release mechanism to make the drug last up to 16 hours (there will be a diminished efffect for the last few hours prior to hour 16).\n\n* By contrast Adderall XR last 8 to 12 hours, where you are still getting theraupetic benefit for at least 8 hours but how many hours prior to that 12 is different in different people.  Some people get 10 hours some people get 12.  Adderall XR uses a 2 bead release mechanism and was FDA approved in 2001.\n\n* The 3 bead idea of Mydayis was already in drug development in the 2000s, but it a process of trial and error of when and how to get the beads to activate at specific times and what specific times do you optimize for (in order to maximize benefits and minimize side effects.)  Mydayis almost got FDA approval in the mid 2000s with Phase 3 testing but the FDA wanted a little more data for while they knew the drug was safe they wanted to know a little more about the occurrences of specific side effects (like is this drug going to cause more insomnia with it lasting so long in the body and so on.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDuring which time in the mid 2000s another drug company was making a different form of Amphetamine called Vyvanse.  \n\n* Adderall is 75% D-AMP and 25% L-AMP (Adderall XR and Mydayis is also 75% D-AMP and 25% L-AMP)\n\n* Dexedrine is 100% D-AMP\n\nDifferent ADHD patients do better on 100% D-AMP vs 75% D-AMP vs 25% L-AMP for there are some on the margin differences on which areas of the 1) frontal lobe vs 2) other brain areas including the emotional brain, plus the basal ganglia, plus the pituitary and hypothalamus.  This can modify side effects  on the margins.  (For example higher D-AMP is more of an appetite suppressant.)\n\nVyvanse is a form of time release Dexedrine that lasts up to 14 hours but does not activate until roughly hour 2, and the full effects occur a little later.\n\n* Vyvanse is a metamolecule / prodrug of Lysine+D-AMP.  Instead of your digestive system breaking down this prodrug your body's red blood cells use an enzyme to separate this larger molecule into the amino acid Lysine (which your body uses to make proteins) and the D-AMP.\n\n* This allows the drug to last up to 14 hours (diminished effects roughly hours 10) and also makes it harder to abuse for if you smoke, inject, or inhale the medicine these other methods do not activate the drug or activate a much lesser amount of the drug while with Adderall the opposite is achieved.\n\nWell Shire notices this other company (New River Pharmaceuticals) was getting great Phase 3 testing and was likely to get approved for ADHD and thus they literally bought the company NRP after NRP submitted the paperwork to be approved for Vyvanse but before the FDA approved the medicine (for this process takes 6 months to 2 years but now a days closer to 6 months with the paperwork being submitted, note the FDA can chose to reject the medicine or say I need more testing and this is actually what happens most of the time.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo Shire because \n\n* Mydayis was still in testing and the FDA wanted more tests, and these tests cost dozens of millions of dollars (sometimes in the low hundred of millions of dollars.)\n\n* Shire just acquired NRP for Vyvanse was a good product and Shire was afraid of losing ADHD marketshare.\n\nBecause of these two things Shire decided to slow walk the remaining process and study of developing Mydayis.  This remaining slow-walk only ended in the last year where they finished another Phase 3 FDA study and resubmitted the paperwork and the FDA approved Mydayis.\n\n* Most likely Shire decided it was a good time to do this for the Adderall XR patents are expiring in 2018 and 2019.  Note there has been 4 different generics of Adderall XR since the years (2012, 2013, 2013, 2016) and some of these generics simulate the same drug release curve with a very similar but slightly different method and some of these generics are doing a revenue sharing model with Shire.  I won't explain the differences of how patents vs temporary exclusivity vs simulating the same type of drug release curve profile via a different method for this post is already 900 words aka almost 2 pages."

    "comment": "I was on Vyvanse for 3 years and got switched to Mydayis in March. There are positives and negatives and I've stayed on it mainly because it lasts so much longer than Vyvanse. \n\n- Mydayis (so far) hasn't had the same kind of crash that I used to get with Vyvanse. It used to be that as my medication started wearing off my anxiety would get higher and my motivation would get lower and after like 7pm I was basically useless for the rest of the evening. Now I'm able to stay productive a lot longer and the process of the medication wearing off is a lot smoother. However I am starting to notice some minor signs of that crash so I am wondering if I am building up a tolerance (which I never did with Vyvanse - 3 years on the same dose). \n\n- When I first started Mydayis, the first wave was great but once the 2nd hit I lost all motivation and started to get depressed. That faded, however so did the effectiveness off the first wave so now I have to wait until the 2nd to be productive at all. That is beginning to fade as well (again, wondering about tolerance) and the third wave is just pretty good. I'm not doing as well with the third as I did with the second but everyone comes home in the evenings and stuff so I have a lot more distractions and there is less expectation to do things. \n\n- I get burnt out really easily and sometimes just need a couple of days to sleep longer or give my brain time to decompress. On Vyvanse I was able to do that and then bounce back, but on Mydayis it's so hard to stop myself from doing things... Which is great on good days, but when I get burnt out it's a lot harder and takes longer to bounce back. \n\n- I get hungry more often on Mydayis because of the three different waves of the medication. Which is probably a good thing. But I don't actually eat when I get hungry, and Mydayis lasts longer so I don't get REALLY hungry until like 11pm and then everyone gets frustrated with me because I'm up making food or running out to get food or asking people to bring things home for me when they all just want to go to bed. (I suppose the easy fix for that is to just eat when I get hungry... But the problem is I have no motivation to get/make food when I get hungry because I'm in between waves of the medication. So I don't eat.)\n\nI've been considering asking my doctor about going back to Vyvanse but adding an IR in the morning (most people I've heard of doing that do it the other way around). I like the IR and the longevity of Mydayis but I seem to building up more of a tolerance and there are less desirable side effects than I had with Vyvanse. But we'll see."

Side effects I‚Äôve never had on any other meds before! I felt like it took forever to kick in (if I took it at 7 AM, I wouldn‚Äôt feel it work until like 10 or 11AM) , and I felt a lot of peaks and valleys throughout the day. The third release felt way stronger than the first two, which would happen around 6 PM if I took it at 7AM. And I felt like every day got worse and worse. After a few weeks, I had really bad anxiety, insomnia, appetite issues, and became really manic, which made me moody, impulsive, etc.\n\nI had been on adderall instant releases for a couple years before I got switched to this, and vyvanse for a couple years before that. I wanted an extended release, so my psychiatrist recommended Mydayis. It took me a while to recover from this med, I just went back on adderall recently, haven‚Äôt had any issues at all!"

(You start seeing the drug entering your blood levels 6 hours before but a clinical strong enough amount happens 8 to 10 hours after taking it due to how the beads in this extended release medicine works.)\n\n* I haven't made a main post yet for I want to be concise and useful at the same time.  Figuring out what specifically to say and what to omit takes time with editing and rewriting and so on.\n\n* Even though the FDA approved this medicine last week, we will not see the med till the 1st half of 2019 in pharmacies for the Drug Company has to get its ducks in the row with making enough meds, pretty packaging, educating doctors, and ^(blah blah blah) logistic stuff."

I understand generally what you are asking but I do not know specifically what you are requesting / asking for and what you want me to share.  ***What more info do you want to know about Jornay PM (formerly called HLD200)***\n\n----\n\nIf your question is about the hour stuff when the med activate, the main sources of the info are the pres release of Jornay PM\n\n* http://www.ironshorepharma.com/pdf/Ironshore-Announces-FDA-Approval-JORNAY-PM.pdf\n\nBut more importantly the graph in the ***prescribing instructions** in pages 12 and 13 which has already been released.\n\n* http://ironshorepharma.com/labeling.pdf\n\n* The plasma level increase is already detectable at hour 6 but the increase is marginal aka a single digit percent wise out of the 100 mg dose.\n\n* It takes 10 hours before the med activates enough to cause a change in the body and brain.\n\n* In testing (not in this links here) with HLD200 they were trying to get at least 8 hours, and they communicated this at least 8 hours with investors.  Personally getting 10 hours instead of 8 is a better thing in my personal opinion.\n\n* Note how this 10 hours works from a mechanic standpoint is complicated.  This is because the first extended release layer works by several mechanisms.  First it will not work unless it is the proper ph which you will not get in the stomach but it has to be in a specific part of the small intestine called the Ileum.  In the Illeum the ph changes to 7 to 8.  Reaching the Illeum takes 6 to 8 hours, but lots of stuff can modify how long it takes to reach the Illeum and what happens once it reaches the Illeum how much and how long the first coating is broken down releasing the first release of the medicine.  For example in the prescribing instructions what you eat in the morning does not impact the drug release for you take the med the night before.  But what you ate the previous night like if the meal was full of at and large can delay the effects of the drugs by 2.5 hours for the \"biggest peak\" which normally occurs 14 hours after you take the medicine the night before.  Thus if you did not ate the night before and you took the med at 10 then the strongest effect of the med happens at noon the next day.\n\n* The previous bullet point is explained well by this video on the maker's website of Jornay PM which explains the Delexis extended release tech that Jornay PM uses http://www.ironshorepharma.com/videos.html#delexis2\n\nNote all the stuff I said above are straight from the drug maker directly and stuff the FDA and the drug maker agreed to."

Most doctors are willing to prescribe them, and they are actually one of the cheaper ADHD meds.  That said some doctors do not like to prescribe higher amounts of D-AMP med (100% D-AMP) that is not Vyvanse, preferring Adderall (75% D-AMP / 25% L-AMP) and Evekeo (50% D-AMP / 50% L-AMP) for if your goal is to get high (which some patients the goal is to get high not to treat ADHD, Narcolepsy, or to lose weight) than higher amounts of D-AMP meds get you high.  These patients also smoke, inject, inhale the med instead of taking the med orally for there is a massive difference in how the meds work if it hits the brain all at once instead of when you take orally where the first amount of the med hits about 20 mins later and there is a gradual increase for not all of the tablet / capsule hits the brain all at once for it is broken down slowly even with the IR versions."

Potential energy but also kinetic energy.\n\n* At the same time certain types of tasks are easy to unlock this potential energy while other tasks are very hard to unlock the potential energy.\n\n* It is a dance figuring out how to use one form of energy to access another form of energy.  It is a dance figuring out how to transform water, earth, sun, and a seed into grapes and then the grapes into wine.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is merely one of the tasks I find easy.  Many other tasks I find hard.\n\n***But did you know?*** (Does the movies with mikey voice)\n\n* That Passion comes from a latin word that means \"I suffer?\" ^(patior / ‚ÄúI suffer‚Äù and passus / ‚Äúsuffered‚Äù)\n\n* That there is a similar word in Greek known as \"pathos\" (\"suffering\").  But \"pathos\" does not just mean suffering but it also means many other things such as anything that excites the feelings / emotions / and passions of yourself or another.\n\n* Pathos is thus one of the 3 modes of rhetoric / persuassion where we use with words or visual imagery we try to trigger emotions in other (the other two are Logos and Ethos).\n\n* Pathos besides meaning to stir up the emotions also means to endure the emotions (endure the small things for ourselves can see the bigger thing and we know it to be worth it) but also where we can find joy, a relief from the negative pains, something that takes the negative pains away much like removing a weight from something that hurts us can excite us and make us feel good for things no longer hurt.  (This relief of pain is different from beauty, this \"delight\" with the removal of pain, or put another way we turn our attention away from the pain and turn our attention to something else that excites us.)\n\n***But did you know?*** (Does the movies with mikey voice)\n\n* Lots of words we have derive from Pathos, such as Empathy and Sympathy and many other ones.  If the word has a -pathy / patho / path ***there is a good chance***^(not an absolute chance) it derives from Pathos, including the word pathetic and pathogen.  (Note Pathetic being full of Scorn instead of Sympathy is a more modern thing and not the older definition.)\n\n>Do you have a passion for learning about medicine?\n\nYes is it not obvious =P"

I ended up finding another thread on reddit where someone mentioned setting a fitness watch/Fitbit type thing to wake them up at 5:30, then take the dose, then go back to bed and wake up in an hour medicated. I started doing that but found myself getting tired around 8 so I switched to taking it at 6:30. \n\nI get tired around 9/10, I have no issues sleeping, and it's improved my concentration and focus.

I think it is 2 IR doses and an extended dose in the afternoon. I feel the first dose and get 4 hours of good focus, depending that I eat sometimes I feel like there is a break between the first and second dose but most of the time I don't notice. The third dose I have never felt and think its pretty weak but at least gives me a few hours to cook dinner and do stuff around the house where as with vyvanse I wouldn't be able to do anything after work. \n\nYou really don't feel medicated, I read somewhere that it's like \"working in the background\" and that made a lot of sense to me. Also, it is SOOO much nicer to my body and I can eat!! \n\nI will note I had really bad anxiety the first week or so not knowing when the next dose would hit but figured it out pretty quickly and now I never have to think about it. \n\nIf you have the chance to try it, I would.

I'm a big fan of fatty foods, sadly, but I guess I don't eat them nearly as much as I think I do. I suppose this could explain some odd digestive stuff from the last few days. Nothing crazy, but noticeable. Will look for the clinical trials results online as well. Thanks for responding!"

I CAN ALSO MULTITASK MUCH MORE EASILY with Mydayis, so that's nice. \n\nI just feel like a better functioning adult and I haven't felt like this in a long long time. Plus the name Mydayis‚Äîliterally my-day-is‚Äî is very apropos for those who suffer from ADHD, especially for those who journal. Loving it. Take it at 7 am and it's good until 8 pm. No jitters."

    "comment": "Thank you for the update. I‚Äôve been following this discussion. I‚Äôve been on Vyvanse 70 for years and have felt is has worked far better than any of the others, all of which made me feel very down, irritable and and kind of meh. Vyvanse lasted longer and has been far smoother. For many years I paid out of pocket because it was such a game-changer for me at work. \n\nAbout the last 8-12 months I have felt like it hasn‚Äôt been working as well and not lasting long enough. I‚Äôm guessing this is me building up a tolerance. My doctor gives me Adderall to take for the last half of the day. It does work, but it literally takes away all my personality and I feel like I‚Äôm present but not really present when trying to engage in conversations. If I‚Äôm focused on my work (accountant) it‚Äôs great. But the second I deviate off of that, I just check out. I also don‚Äôt like trying to remember to take something in the middle of the day.\n\nMy doctor suggested Mydayis a while ago. But when I went to pick it up, it was a hard pass when I got the price. My insurance will not cover it. They tell me to stick with Vyvanse, which thankfully they now cover. But I‚Äôm starting to think it might be worth just shelling out the cash for the Mydayis after reading other responses."

It just doesn't seem to be working anymore. Takes wayyyy to long to kick in like 3 hours.  I'm so tired and run down all the time. The struggle to get motivated to do anything is real. Multitasking is a nightmare. I feel frozen a lot like I can't make decisions so I do nothing. If I skip the Vyvanse on weekend I have more energy and drive to conquer tasks for about 2 to 3 hours when I wake up then I crash and just want to sleep all day. Hoping Mydayis is a fresh start. I switch tomorrow."

For example, on Adderall XR, I could absolutely feel when the first round wore off and the second round kicked in. Have you noticed any decrease in effectiveness over the last two months?"

I just got back from vacation and yeah I gained a couple lbs but they were needed. I ate so much delicious food and actually finished my meals instead of taking a few bites and feeling full and then guilty that I was wasting food. I have been so much more active too. Probably because I am eating and have more energy to go for long bike rides and hikes. I don't feel like I've been hit by a truck or lost in brain fog if I skip a day. I didn't want to take it the day we were flying back because I had a really late flight and had to work the next day. I wanted to sleep on the plane. I was able to function during the day without feeling exhausted and confused. I didn't have any overwhelming desire to find a random place to take a nap. Lol on Vyvanse if I skipped a say I would seriously look at random places like oh I really wish I could just crawl under that table and take a nap right now. ü§£ \nI have been a lot more productive at work and in life too."

    "comment": "Hello. I made the switch on 10-19-23. I didn‚Äôt know there was a generic when I ordered a refill & my Doc always writes Rx as Mydayis, naturally. But I finally got it, after much scrambling from my pharmacy and doctor, (because the insurance company had programmed denial of the name brand into their system for the day the generic was released, but didn‚Äôt send the patients nor the pharmacies nor the doctors any heads up). Anyway, I had been without either the name brand 50mg  nor the generic for a couple weeks. When I took the first Teva generic 50mg it was like a jolt of caffeine, lol. It wasn‚Äôt horrible, it was fine. But now on my 2nd month, mentally it doesn‚Äôt seem like I‚Äôm on Mydayis. I‚Äôm a lot more lethargic and lower energy. Another thing I noticed about this darker solid blue capsule, is that it bleeds the dye. I had trouble swallowing it on the first try once and it was a mess!! Never have I had that experience with a prescription capsule before LOL. I think I will wait until next Dr appt to change back to name brand. I would be willing to try a different generic brand than Teva when their exclusivity rights expire though. \nAt the beginning of new insurance year, I pay $425-ish out of pocket for name brand Mydayis before deductible kicks in. I pay $312.60 for the generic until my new deductible is met üòï\nHope this info helps in some way for you. Thanks for asking others about their experience as well.

    "comment": "My pharmacy and Dr have been a mess...buckle up\n\nI was on 12.5mg and already felt kinda on the edge of effectiveness with name brand, generic was definitely subpar, so decided to try bumping up to 25 with last fill a week and a half ago. I really wish mydayis had smaller increments because it's definitely too much. But I also got the 25 mg filled name as brand... \n\nThe same pharmacy that delayed me two days to wait for generic mydayis, filled my script as 25 Adderall xr (always check before you leave the building kids). Somewhere between Dr and pharmacy, the script was written as amphetamine extended release. They are definitely different extended releases but in the system it just looked like Adderall xr. I give the pharmacist credit, he spent an hour sorting this at 9pm. Best he could do was fill as name brand mydayis. Thank goodness insurance still covered (I already had to pay one month full price when insurance asked for prior Auth in the 2nd month, that whole 'nother mess of having to \"fail\" 3 stimulants and trying Adderall xr in order to get the approval. The fail 3 stimulants makes no damn sense when technically they are all just variants of two molecules) but yeah, it's too strong... I've been seeing if I adjust and have propranolol to make it tolerable, but *sigh*\n\nI double checked my first generic bottle, it says teva \"generic for Adderall xr, mydayis\" wtf noooooo, those are different drugs. Maybe that's why 12.5 mg generic felt worse? \n\nPharmacist said to make sure Dr writes as name brand, do not substitute to avoid this mess in future, so the saga continues. \n\nTrying a new Dr next week anyway because I haven't been loving this one (he's new too when the Dr I loved left the practice) but at least he'll do what I ask for pretty much. I just filled out paperwork and she drug tests, so my hopes have tanked. We'll see what happens when I tell her I'll test positive for cannabis and that's not gonna change.\n\nDunno if any of that answers your questions, but good luck and check your script before leaving the building!"
