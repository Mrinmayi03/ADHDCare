Well, I say option, technically I was prescribed TO take 4 a day, but if I needed to wind down earlier than normal, I could just opt out of taking the second dose or only take one pill for the second dose. I rarely did this, but I did like that it was an option. \n\nAnd yeah, I was kind of weary on even posting this because I ALWAYS catch the \"< 2% reported (insert weird symptom)\" on medications. But maybe if anyone reading up on Evekeo tends to be the same way, they can at least be fore warned to be on the lookout for those symptoms. \n\nAdding chemicals to a body full of chemicals.... there's just noooooo telling lol"

    "comment": "I've recently started taking it. It's a new drug, and I'm switching over from adderal.\n\nFrom my understanding, it's supposed to be good for people who are taking lower doses (I take two 10MGs twice a day).\n\nWhen I took adderall, I was prescribed the same amount, (10 mg twice a day) but on certain days- like tuesday when I have a 14 hour day) I would need to take \"extra\" (20-25MG at a time).\n\nIt's only been a short time, but I'm confused about how I feel about Evekeo. One pill- 10 MG seems to \"kick in\" REALLY fast for me. Within a short period of time, I'm feeling almost \"high\" -- Kind of like how I feel when I take a lot of adderal. I wouldnt call it a high so much as a- I feel really really really focused. But I almost don't like it- my skin tingles and when I'm working I feel like I'm going fast and being efficient, but I'm going so quickly I'm doing things like moving my mouse across the computer screen too aggressively and end up clicking in the wrong place, so I have to go back and correct mistakes.\n\nHowever, this hyper focus only seems to last a short period of time for me. Like maybe forty five minutes. And then it goes away completely and I feel normal again.\n\nExcept I'm definitely not normal- While I can't feel the drug and there's a part of me that feels like and wonders- hey, this wore off really quickly and now I'm not on my ADHD medication, I look back at the last hour or so and realize I did a TON of work. \n\nSo my jury is still out on Evekeo, but so far I think I like it better than any other ADHD medication I've taken. It seems to work well for me with no side effects at a much lower dose than adderall does. It takes a lot more adderal than 10mg at a time for me to really feel productive. The hyper/crazy/focus only lasts a short time and then I feel so normal and Evekeo seems like it is just being very effective without me realizing. With the exception of that initial time period where I feel very strongly like I'm on a drug- I don't even feel like I'm taking medication. I feel so normal, except in retrospect I am accomplishing more and being better without even realizing it. It's really quite nice.\n\nI know you posted this question awhile ago, so now that you've had your Evekeo for awhile, whats you opinion? I feel a little weird trying a drug thats so new- there is NO information online about it from people who have tried it- and I'm trying to determine if I want to keep on Evekeo or go back to adderall after the month is over."

It took forever for the pharmacy to get it so i really have only used it a few times at this point. I definitely prefer it to the vyvanse and adderall. Have you tried focalin?

    "comment": "I have been on 10 mg twice daily of Evekeo since last April. It worked fantastically, until a month or two ago, and the 20 mg/day dose no longer seemed sufficient. A week ago I visited my doctor for my regular appointment. Because of the cost of Evekeo, which I have a coupon for but my insurance doesn't cover, I was interested in saving some money by trying Adderall IR (20 mg twice/day). This change was purely savings-motivated, because my doctor was willing to increase my prescription of Evekeo (which would make me incur more cost). I requested one week of Adderall because I was worried about the change -- I have anxiety problems, Evekeo doesn't seem to trigger the anxiety and I was concerned the Adderall would. But again, I was focused on potentially saving over $100/month. My doctor suggested two weeks to try the Adderall, but he didn't say why. I didn't want to challenge him, so I accepted and went on my way.\n\nI called my doctor last Thursday because I was experiencing very adverse side effects, both physical and mental. Keep in mind I quit the Evekeo abruptly and began with the Adderall. Doc says he can't call in my Evekeo early, and I must wait out the two weeks with the Adderall. Fuck. Well, OK, it can't be so bad, right? Then, over the weekend I began to feel very disconnected, just weird. If you've ever changed antidepressants -- it felt a lot like that. Kind of like feeling your synapses slowly sizzling. WTF?! I didn't think there was supposed to be any withdrawal from amphetamine other than some sleepiness. But this was WEIRD.\n\nThen I talked to a friend who had a prescription for Evekeo and abruptly quit when she had an insurance coverage gap. She said quitting cold turkey definitely made her feel weird for a week or so. Uncomfortable and disconnected.\n\nCut to today. After my bad/weird symptoms over the weekend I again contacted my doctor -- he'll refill my Evekeo 'script early if I come in and do a drug screen (which they said I was due for). I oblige and he phones me back with the results: positive for MDMA and benzodiazepine. I'm STUNNED, because I have ingested neither substance in a LONG time. Keep in mind this is an in-office drug testing kit that they will send to a lab to validate. I'm so upset that I'm crying on the phone with my doctor. I feel like I'm in a Kafa-esque nightmare. I feel even more gaslighted when my doctor insists that there are no symptoms from amphetamine withdrawal other than drowsiness. WHAT?! What kind of doctor tells his patient she's suffering incorrect symptoms??\n\nI insist on coming back and taking ANOTHER TEST, because I'm convinced they've tested the wrong sample. The nurse is kind, patient and listens to me (which is something the doctor didn't do). I submit another urine sample (which is hard to produce because I was feeling so flustered). The nurse shows me the results, which are similar to the first test. There is some ambiguity in the way the test results can be read, and I wouldn't have read them as positive for MDMA or benzos myself. But let's just say these two don't show a strong negative. The sample will continue to the lab for analysis, which I'm certain will prove I haven't a trace of either MDMA or benzos in my system. But it's been a horrible day y'all. Just surreal.\n\nTL;DR: 20 mg/day of Evekeo worked well for about 8 months then I felt I needed something more. I switched to Adderall (without weaning off/on) to save money under the guidance of a doctor. Abruptly quitting the Evekeo gave me strange mental and physical side effects not unlike switching anti depressants."

Intuitively one would think Adderall IR @ 10mg or 12.5 in the same quantity would probably be the most similar but it's my opinion that the two non sulfate amphetamine compounds within it alter its overall pharmacology.  \n\nThere is a savings card as well.\n\nhttp://www.adzenysxrodthcp.com/tools-support/savings-card/"

Felt like I could function like a normal person, minus the awful crashes I would get at the end of the night. Which the 5 in the afternoon was supposed to help, but mostly it just wouldn't let me sleep. I had trouble eating as well. In late November I had a bit of a mental break. Everything had been going well, graduated school and got a job, had an amazing boyfriend and awesome apartment in a great city. And around thanksgiving I snapped. I tore up the apartment, quit my job, broke up with the boyfriend and ruined everything I had been working for. My memory of that awful night is fuzzy. I have never had any moments of blackout rage like that before. I stopped taking eveko after that, mostly because I was packed off to my sister's and I couldn't bother finding a new psychiatrist. I don't know what role eveko played in my breakdown, but I don't want to go on it again.

It's still fairly new so there isn't much testimonial about it unfortunately.  \n\nIn my experience, it felt kind of like an energy drink. I was energized and could focus better while it was effective. I took it twice or thrice a day, totalling 30mg/day. When it started to wear off I got irritable and very anxious. I was a little jittery as well. I did notice it immediately working with the first dose and there were many beneficial effects.  \n\nI stopped the Evekeo because it ramped up my anxiety more than I liked and it was 3x more expensive than generics on my insurance and only at a specialty pharmacy, so I wanted to try other options.  \n\nWhat is your dosage? Schedule? I noticed it worked best if I ate it soon after a meal (breakfast and lunch).  Maybe try different things like when and how you take it and pay very close attention to what is happening. Keep a journal of your moods and thoughts!  \n\nI'm still pretty scattered after all of this time. Right now I'm on Ritalin, 3/day after trying the Evekeo and I tried Strattera as well.. I figure that much of this being scattered, for me at least, is just habit. I was diagnosed as an adult with no prior treatment at all, so I think that these ADHD habits and behaviors and thought processes are just so ingrained in my head. It's going to take a lot to get rid of them, but that's where therapy and self teaching come in.  \nFor example, I can focus so much better now, but that doesn't mean it is on what I should be focusing on. Things like that. The medication is like glasses, it clears things up so I can learn better behaviors.  \n\nI'm very sorry for the novel but, well, you know.

    "comment": "In **most ADHD people** 100% D-Amp is better than the 75 / 25% of Adderall and is better than the 50 / 50% of Evekeo but that is not the case of all ADHD people.  In some ADHD people a less \"pure form\" with more L-Amp and less D-Amp  is better.\n\nWhen you make Amphetamine you get a mixture of 50% L-Amp and 50% D-Amp, to get a different mixture such as Adderall or Dexedrine you have to do additional steps to remove some of the L-Amp.\n\n[Picture 1 to make the next part make sense](https://books.google.com/books?id=yOq3BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA46&dq=adhd+brain+networks&source=gbs_selected_pages&cad=3#v=onepage&q=adhd%20brain%20networks&f=false)\n\nD-Amp is 3 to 5x stronger at influencing Dopamine  in the **Mesolimbic Areas and the Frontal Striatal Areas** vs L-Amp, two areas implemented in ADHD but other areas are implemented as well.  This is because in those areas Dopamine is controlled by a reuptake protein called DAT and D-Amp is 3 to 5x stronger at blocking the DAT protein. 80% of the Brains Dopamine is used in the Frontal Striatal Areas\n\nAmphetamine both D-Amp and L-Amp also block an additional reuptake protein called NET.  NET is the reuptake protein that controls Norepinephrine, but it also controls Dopamine in the Frontal Lobe via the Mesocortical Pathway.  Your frontal lobe needs dopamine to function, but your limbic areas (areas tied to some aspects of emotion, especially automatic thinking emotion) and the striatal areas need dopamine more than the frontal lobe (the striatum is the brains fine tuner of lots of things such as movement, deciding what to do, emotion, etc.)  Both D-Amp and L-Amp are roughly the same at influencing NET\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow too much Dopamine in the reward center and the striatum can be a bad thing too.  This article from Scientific American and one of the leading ADHD researchers explain why\n\n[PDF: This is your Brain on Meltdown](http://www.brazosport.edu/faculty-staff/directory/IsaiahSchauer/Biol%201407/6_GB2_BrainMeltdown_2012SciAm_Neuroscience.pdf)\n\nAs Amy Arnsten and two other Yale Psychs explain, too much dopamine actually turns off Frontal Lobe control of motor behavior.  It does not turn off all the frontal lobe but the area roughly around Brodmann Area 10 [Picture](http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v10/n9/images/nrn2667-f1.jpg) which deals with abstract goals in the long term future, while other frontal lobes and the emotional brain are more action oriented vs trying to figure out what is the best goal.\n\nThus while some dopamine is good for the frontal lobe, too much dopamine is actually counter productive and puts you in an over aroused state such as the fight or flight mode.  You can focus very well but you may focus on the wrong things, or you may be anxious, or you may have now a worse working memory than before.  You are a creature driven by impulsivity and compulsivity.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBelieve it or not we have known about this for over a 100 years now, it is only in the last few decades and the last few years we specifically identify the chemicals and the receptor subtypes that cause this.  (Dr. Amy Arnsten is one of the leading experts at identifying these receptor subtypes I am about to link to, especially the alpha 2a which effects on working memory her lab at Yale identified)\n\n[Picture: The goldilocks zone of attention is an inverted U also known as Yerkes–Dodson 1908 law](http://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/article/publishingimages/2009/v70n07/v70n0701/v70n0701f1.gif)\n\nNow there are other neurotransmitters and stuff with Yerkes Dodson but these are the main two with working memory.  Too much dopamine shuts off the frontal lobe, while too little and we do not use the frontal lobe at all instead doing impulsivity and compulsivity.\n\n**Is this starting to make sense? I am about to bring it all together**\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBecause D-Amp is a more effective drug at the mesolimbic and frontal striatal networks than L-Amp sometimes it is too good of a job, where you are influencing dopamine too much too quickly.  In such a case you actually want more inhibtion of NET just like a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor such as Strattera.  Eveko because its a 50:50 mixture is weaker at influencing the emotional and striatal brain areas than Adderall, and Adderall is weaker at influencing these areas than a similar dose of Vyvanse or Dexedrine.\n\nIn other words we are purposefully using a weaker frontal limbic area drug for both L-Amp and D-Amp are about equally effective in the frontal lobe areas, but D-Amp is stronger in other Dopamine pathways.  This allows us to not overshoot that hill, that goldilock zone and make those brain areas \"too hot\", \"too over aroused.\"\n\nNow there are other numerous differences between D-Amp and L-Amp like L-Amp is more likely to cause cardiovascular symptoms like higher blood pressure and pulse.  There is also differences between things like energy levels, for by getting a drug that is a little more NET based and a little less DAT you are influencing the norepinephrine neurotransmitters a little more than a similar dosage of Adderall or Dexedrine or Vyvanse.  But once again we are talking things on the margins, and in most people a higher D-Amp is more effective.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#[Picture of the 5 brain networks involved with ADHD from teh Washingtion Post](http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/national/your-brain-on-adhd/1716/)\n\nSee that brain network which is very complicated looking.  Notice the attention network from the front of the brain to the back of the brain.  Well your brain focuses on different types of things, depending on what the frontal striatal and frontal limbic network (reward network but also other emotions) dopamine, norepinephrine, but also other neurotransmitters such as serotonin levels are.  We actually have names for these various attention networks such as Ventral Attention Network, and Dorsal Attention Network but I will not go into this for I am done and am tired of writing and I bet you are tired of reading :P"

    "comment": "So we have 4 forms of Amphetamine that we use to treat ADHD.  Amphetamine has two different forms of the molecules called D-AMP and L-AMP.  D-AMP and L-AMP are made out of the same number of atoms but 3 of the atoms can have more of a rightward / clockwise direction, or a counterclockwise / leftward spin.\n\nWhy does this matter?  Well in some areas of the brain the clockwise / rightward spin is stronger, in other areas of the brain the two forms of amphetamine are equally as strong.\n\nThus the different versions of amphetamine may have different side effects in **individual** ADHD patients, for sometimes you want the stronger version for it may treat ADHD better, but sometimes it will produce more side effects.  Aka it is finding out which one you will respond best to.\n\n-----\n\nNow here is the simple guide of the different forms of Amphetamine.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Evekeo is 50% L-AMP and 50% D-AMP\n\n* Adderall Instant Release is 25% L-AMP and 75% D-AMP\n\n* Dexedrine Instant Release, Dextrostat Instant Release, Zenzedi^(Made by the same company as Evekeo) Instant Release is 0% L-AMP and 100% D-AMP  Procentra is Dexedrine in a liquid instant release format.\n\n* Vyvanse is a different molecule than D-AMP and L-AMP, it is called a prodrug where the molecule of D-AMP is bonded with another molecule and your body via enzymes will then cleave that molecule into two molecules and one of these molecules will then be D-AMP.  Aka Vyvanse is a form of time release D-AMP, with your enzymes in your body doing the time release nature.\n\nSo which one of these 4 medicines you will respond better to is a process of **systematic** trial and error.  All 4 medicines work the same generally , but some people may find they have less side effects on 1 than the other, or they may find out they do better on 1 medicine vs another.  The higher the amount of D-AMP the better it works on the impulsivity / hyperactivity symptoms of ADHD, now the inattentive symptoms of ADHD is all about finding the right balance of D-AMP and L-AMP and some people do better on Evekeo, some on Adderall, some on Dexedrine / Zenzedi, etc.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow besides those 4 classes of Instant Release Meds I mentioned above there are time release forms of these meds as well.\n\n* Dexedrine Spansules are capsules of Dexedrine Instant Release for 50% of the Med, and 50% of the Med activates a few hours later.  We are still talking about a short duration 6 to 8 hour med.  Aka 100% D-AMP\n\n* Vyvanse is a 10 to 14 hour med.  With it taking an hour longer to kick in compared to Dexedrine Instant Release.  Remember Vyvanse is a prodrug form of 100% D-AMP\n\n* Adderall XR is a 8 to 12 hour form of 25% L-AMP and 75% D-AMP\n\n* Adzensys XR ODT is a 8 to 12 hour form of 25% L-AMP and 75% D-AMP in a oral disintegrating tablet that dissolves on your tongue.  Its duration is meant to be identical as Adderall XR\n\n* Dynanvel XR is a 23.8% L-AMP and 76.2% D-AMP liquid extended release medicine.  The duration is roughly equal to Adderall XR but key word is **roughly equal**, while Adzensys XR ODT is supposed to be the same due to bioequvalency.\n\n* Mydavis is a new form of Adderall made by the same company (Shire) who makes Adderall XR, but with an up to 16 hour duration instead of the 8 to 12 hour duration.  It is a 3 bead time release system instead of the 2 bead time release system Adderall XR uses.  This is a brand new med that just came out a few months ago.\n\n**So far** there is no form of time released / extended release Evekeo (50% L-AMP / 50% D-AMP).  I am not aware of any form of time released Evekeo in FDA trials.\n\n-----\n\nUnderstand the next 5 years of ADHD meds we may see **up to** another 5 different brands of Amphetamine meds enter the market such as skin patches, meds you take the night before and they activate 8 hours later, more prodrugs, tamper / abuse resistant forms of amphetamine etc.  Aka we are going to get lots more choices on the market.  Furthermore besides about 5 different drugs in different formats that may be released in the next 5 years, we are going to get more generic competition where a generic is approved and can be substituted at the pharmacy for it is shown to be bio equivalent."

    "comment": "Evekeo is a racemic amphetamine formulation (50% levoamphetamine, 50% dextroamphetamine). It's kind of similar to Adderall, except that Adderall has a different ratio of levoamphetamine to dextroamphetamine.\n\nAs for asking for experience, nobody else's experiences have any bearing on how your son will experience the medication, because it is not possible to determine how your son will react. Given that he HAS reacted positively to another amphetamine (Vyvanse is lisdexamfetamine, which is metabolically processed into dextroamphetamine), it is probably safe to assume that your son will react well to Evekeo.\n\nHowever, I question the doctor's judgment about switching to another medication. ADHD medications are not a cure: they will not instantly turn him into a productivity machine, and medication does not teach life skills like time and task management. He *still has to put in conscious effort* to do stuff; the medications just make *doing stuff* easier. It sounds like your son would benefit from therapy that will help him make the most of his medication.\n\nAlso, I don't think it's realistic to expect consistency even with stimulants, because stimulants only treat *some* of the symptoms of ADHD. Recent research shows that stimulant and non-stimulant (atomoxetine, guanfacine, clonidine) combinations are extremely effective and well-tolerated in many people with ADHD, because the stimulants and non-stimulants largely treat separate groups of symptoms (with about 10-30% overlap in symptom coverage)."

    "comment": "Use the search on the side for there has been a couple threads by Evekeo.\n\nEffectively the numbers of atoms in amphetamine can be organized in two different shapes, D-Amp and L-Amp aka it is like playing Tetris and you having an L that faces the right and an L that faces the left.\n\nVyvanse is a time released formulation called a prodrug that is 100% D-Amp\n\nAdderall is 75% D-Amp and 25% L-Amp\n\nEvekeo is 50% D-Amp and 50% L-Amp\n\nD-Amp is stronger in one area of the brain.  Often this stronger acting D-Amp is a good thing, but you can also have too much stimulation in this brain area so a small percent would do better with Evekeo or Adderall vs Vyvanse but most ADHD people do better with a  higher amount of D-Amp, but this does not occur in all people due to co-existing conditions which another name is comorbidities.\n\n-----\n\nThe only way to find out if he does better or worse is to do a short term trial, you do not have to do a 30 day prescription, you can always do a smaller amount.  Evekeo has a free trial going that you may qualify for.\n\nhttps://www.evekeo.com/patient-savings-support/free-trial\n\nNow one very big downside is Evekeo is **not time released.**  The pill is meant to only last 4 to 6 hours and then you take a follow up dose.  Thus some people will see this as a downside unless you need a booster at the end of the day for your vyvanse is wearing off too early."

We also do not expect that the stimulants will provide consistency.  I mis-wrote what I meant to say, which is that my son will do well on the doctor's test partially because he knows what to expect from the tests after four years of this med trial type stuff -- I meant to say that he cannot be consistent with his motivation to achieve at an even mid-range level.  It's stunning what he can do under pressure, but he cannot self-regulate in order to plan, or be vigilant in doing what it takes to do college classes or probably even hold down a job.  \n\nEnough people on this sight have spoken to their ability with certain medications to be able to overcome the very thing that I am talking about -- vigilance in keeping up with responsibilities -- so I don't think that I'm asking for the moon here.  I just want my son to be able to have a shot at a normal life.\n\nAlso, the doctor is a specialist in ADD.  His judgment is pretty sound.  What he is failing to do, in this particular instance, is recognize that although my son does great on these very particular tests, he is still incredibly tired on the level of medication that he is given.  Tired + ADD-pi is a disaster.  Sleepiness while on stimulants seems to be (to me) the exact opposite of what one would expect, when what one is looking for is ability to concentrate. The THERAPIST is the one who suggested a possible med trial with a new medication, so there is some disagreement between the therapist and the ADD doctor.  Frustrating, but not all that unusual.\n\nAs far as experience goes, most people know that when someone on this site asks for others \"experiences\" they do so with the understanding that everybody reacts differently to these medications.  I've been living this ADD experiene with my son for a decade, so I've got that part pretty much covered.  But, there are trends, such as the trend that people with ADD-pi \"tend\" to do better on Adderall than other medications, or that they \"tend\" to do better on less medication rather than more medication.  THAT is the kind of \"experience\" I am asking about.  I've read the pamphlet about Evekeo, so I already knew the information you were providing.  Thank you for responding, though."

If your son is using Cymbalta for depression, then Strattera may very well be a better alternative, because recent research has shown that it is very effective in treating depression that is comorbid with ADHD. If he's taking Cymbalta for anxiety, then guanfacine or clonidine may be better alternatives, because they also treat ADHD (they cover different symptoms than stimulants, so provide greater coverage) and *also* reduce the negative side effects of stimulants (increased blood pressure and anxiety). I'd bring these up with your son's doctor."

For example its an off label ADHD medication but sometimes ADHD people benefit from Modafinil and its cousin Armodafinil which are day time sleepiness medicines that promote wakefulness.  In the US the Modafinil and Armodafinil go by the brand names Provigil and Nuvigil.

They should coordinate with your son's psychiatrist so the *psychiatrist* can make recommendations.\n\nAs for feeling tired on his medication: you said he's taking Cymbalta. Excessive fatigue/tiredness is a side effect of it, according to [this site](http://www.drugs.com/cymbalta.html). It is probably the Cymbalta making him feel this way, so changing the stimulant your son is taking almost certainly won't make a difference. I'd bring up this fact with the doctor before changing which stimulant your son takes.\n\n> As far as experience goes, most people know that when someone on this site asks for others \"experiences\" they do so with the understanding that everybody reacts differently to these medications.\n\nYou'd be surprised. We repeat this info a lot because there are many people who *don't* know that, and assume that most people will experience stimulant medication similarly (kind of how like how opioids have the same general analgesic effects for the vast majority of people)."

I.e. more norepinephrine action and less on dopamine. Might make for less emotional comedown symptoms, but I'm not sure why else it would be touted as anti-anxiety. If it works as an antidepressant, it would be along the lines of Wellbutrin, I'd imagine; l-amphetamine lasts pretty much all day, so the constant physical stimulation would at least remove physiological inertia from the depression equation.\n\nPresumably it's being marketed for people more toward the PI end."

The instant release Adderall was great other than the fast talking, on-the-move, hyper-focus that it gave me until the crash came in mid-afternoon. Vyvanse was a nice, steady up and down throughout the day, but the lower dosages seemed to stop working early in the day hence the bump to 60mg before I couldn't afford it, because of my wonderful insurance. I've only been on the Adderall XR for about a month. Originally, it was 20mg, and just bumped to 40mg (two pills) a couple of days ago. So far, it seems very similar, for me, to Vyvanse as far as the ups and downs throughout the day. What really helps with any of the meds is to use the \"up\" time to pick out your priorities, make your lists, and figure out the best ongoing system. Nutrition and some sort of exercise are also factors in how well the meds work. I usually forget to eat on the meds, so I now have reminders throughout the day so that I'll get food in me. I just recently started exercising again to see if that helps get me through the down times or the days when the meds seem to not be working (for whatever reason)."

Also gave me an occasional headache but that may have been anxiety related.\n\nNot currently.\n\nPast experiences with brain training find that it works at teaching you how to do the type of skill the brain training is teaching you but this does not externalize.  See cogmed studies, and the neurofeedback studies where they used a double blind instead of an open label.  For example the neurofeedback they were sending you random data for the control vs the desired eeg they were testing it against.\n\n----\n\nNow when you mix wellbutrin and vyvanse understand both of them are reuptake inhibitors of dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake transporters.  Thus you may need a lower dose of vyvanse and it will take some trial and error to find the right dose for you.\n\nThen again it may require no change for nicotine causes changes in a neurotransmitter than then eventually effects dopamine, so by removing cigarettes you may get a similar result.  Same thing as a nicotine skin patch, or gum."

Im not positive  of the exact effect on norepinephrine, but I think it rides on the coattails of the dopamine release.\nMethylphenidate gave me apocalyptic anxiety even in low dose. Also worsened depression. Methylphenidate is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. \nI remember reading somewhere that reuptake inhibitors can diminish the potency of agonists, even though it may seem from their effects alone that they would synergize. I've never tried this.  \n\nI have had to use nicotine gum before. I was broke and fiending for smokes and a helpful but non-smoker relative bought me nicotine gum. It took the edge off but didnt satisfy the craving. I eventually acquired a pack of cigarettes and smoked them with the nicotine gum, though it was warned against. Eventually threw away the rest of it as it was unpleasant to the stomach. \n\nA nicotine patch I had to use during a stay in the hospital. Initial cravings for cigarettes lingered and were frustrating, but severe nicotine withdrawals did not develop. They also had me doped up on phenobarbital and antipsychotics. I would imagine there was some effect there. I was very agitated. But I think that was solely a reaction to the situation i was in and the circumstances that had led me there.\n\nI imagine with both the vyvanse and wellbutrin together physical side effects might worsen. Heart palpitation, insomnia might worsen. I might end up feeling too doped up. Maybe I will wait until I hit another spell of depression to give this a test."

    "comment": "Vyvanse and all amphetamines work in several ways.\n\n1) It activates a specific type of receptor called TAAR1 (it is not a dopamine or norepinephrine receptor in the name) and TAAR1 tells the nerve to get read to fire and release its neurotransmitters.\n\n2) It also forces  out dopamine and norepinephrine from the storage closets (the synaptic vesicles) via reversing the VMAT2 reuptake transporter for the storage closets.  Effectively amphetamine is VMAT2 favorite child, and this child then pushes out all competition placing those neurotransmitters inside the cell.\n\n3) It also forces out dopamine and norepinephrine from the nerve cell via reversing the reuptake transporters NET and DAT.  Just like it reversed VMAT2 in step 2.  Since reuptake transporters can only go 1 direction at a time, this in turn forces neurotransmitters not to be re uptake.  This is the 2nd way a drug can be a reuptake inhibitor, by making an incoming ramp into an outgoing ramp.  Methylphenidate like concerta merely blocks NET and DAT reuptake transporters.\n\nTogether 1, 2, 2 is the reason why amphetamines are called releasing agents, even though step 3 is a form of reuptake inhibition.\n\nAmphetamine in high doses also acts as a MAOI inhibitor which is a 4th method of action.\n\nNow when you combine a reuptake inhibitor and a releasing agent that means neurotransmitters will spend less time **inside the cell** and more times between the nerve synapses between cell 1 and cell 2.  It is very dangerous for neurotransmitters to be inside the cell but not in the synaptic vesicles neurotransmitter closets for the neurotransmitters if they last too long inside the cell can damage parts of the cell like the mitochondria.  Being between nerve cells within the synapses is very safe, being in the synaptic vesicles is safe and the whole reason why you have synaptic vesicles."

For example one person may have a bigger problem with the reward area and focusing while another person may need more help with working memory and processing in the frontal lobe.\n\nSo why would you possibly want a drug that is weaker than adderall in the emotional brain and the striatum?  Possibly because your adderall or vyvanse was creating side effects at a higher dose such as emotional flattening, irritability, motor tics, etc.  Yet you need a higher dose to treat your ADHD, or you want to try a higher dose before the side effects happened for a low dose did not give you enough symptom relief.\n\nIt is merely trial and error to find which of these 3 amphetamines combinations work best for you and what dose.  Evekeo is pretty much the same thing we had since 1937 with benzedrine.  In the 70s and 80s we removed some drugs from the market if their benefit to side effects ratios were not good enough.  Well the higher D-Amp versions work better for more ADHD people vs the 50/50 mixture so Benzedrine was removed.

I'm pretty sure I'm going to ask to try Strattera next but it seems counterintuitive because Strattera and l-amp (from my understanding) both are strong inhibitors of NET and I had the best effects when quickly reducing the dose of l-amp.\n\nThe stimulants my doctor and I have tried have really helped in many ways but least so in terms of being about to sit down and focus.

I feel generally less focused on Evekeo. I am going to keep giving it a try but unless I start seeing noticeable differences- I'm more than likely going to be switching back to Adderall IR.  But as we know, everyone reacts differently to meds.\n\nPlus! Being that Evekeo is a newly released amphetamine (also cleared by the FDA for weight loss..sigh) it is insanely expensive.  They quoted me over the phone $360/60 10mg dosages.  Thankfully the first 60 that I received were a free trial."

I do have an addictive personality so I am letting my mom dispense them. My doctor is pretty good about listening to my requests, I am considering trying something with methylphenidate next month if this doesn't work out and I was also wondering if I have issues with anxiety and sleeping already, should I ask him for something to help out with that?"

    "comment": "I switched from Vyvanse (40mg) to Evekeo (10mg x 2), since Vyvanse gave me side effects like some increased heartrate and anxiety, as well as agitating crashes and a little acid reflux.\n\nFor me, Evekeo, which is instant release 50/50 d-amph/l-amph, kicks in after about 45 minutes, (gives me like 15 minutes of euphoria) and has about 1.5 or 2 hours of focus. Then I have a crash a few hours later and causes me to be perhaps worse than before. I actually have worse anxiety, longer periods of increased heartrate, and worse acid reflux. But the effects are going to vary a lot from person to person. Like, for me, I'm diagnosed with anxiety. At first, the crash effects made me feel sick like a cold or something and then settled down after a couple weeks.\n\nIt is a temporary anti-depressant, I suppose. And it is energizing and helps me focus for a bit. But ultimately I want to find something else since I find the limited benefits and excessive side effects to be annoying... isn't Evekeo just a revival of benzedrine?"

    "comment": "Preface: every body is different. Your reaction to dexedrine or evekeo may be worlds away from my own. I'm also untrained, so my answer is anecdotal and backed by my own research. And, I don't see many evekeo-specific posts on this sub :) \n\nEvekeo is a 50/50 blend of racemic amphetamine salts dextroamphetamine and levo-amphetamine. Dexedrine, on the other hand, is pure dextroamph. In general, levo-amphetamine affects production of norepinephrine, which mediates the effect of the medication on the peripheral nervous system. Dextroamphetamine stimulates the central nervous system with dopamine production, which produces a bit of norepinephrine indirectly. \n\nI like to think of levo-amph as the fire under your ass that gets you up, makes you feel like you have to do something productive, makes you vigilant. It's also largely responsible for the hypertension, sweating, profound anxiety, dry mouth, and cardiovascular effects of the drug. Of course dextro-amph can produce these side effects to some degree as well, but personally, its therapeutic value (motivation, clarity, focus) is worth the chance of discomfort. I'm prescribed evekeo now and I find myself very sensitive to the physical, peripheral side effects of the levo-amph (not to mention the ridiculously high co-pay, since evekeo's patented). I'm meeting with my prescriber to discuss switching to dexedrine or perhaps adderall. \n\nIf you find the 50/50 blend too strong, please do the same :)"

I feel like I'm ok where I'm at now (10mg IR twice daily + 1 XR 20mg) but sometimes I think I should take my IR tab three times a day or switch to 20mg IR twice daily (doc says that's too much). I think maybe Vyvanse would work better but I don't want to go through the whole getting acclimated and figuring out what dose is right thing.

    "comment": "I feel you, and share your questions and concerns.\n\nYou can be absolutely certain that there are very meaningful, objective differences between all ADHD meds, *especially* across classes (methylphenidate vs. amphetamine vs. non-stim).\n\nEven *within* a given class, almost everyone responds differently to each medication, and there is no way to predict who will react best to what.\n\n**It's best to accept this fact early on: dialing in the right dose of the right kind of medication will take a lot of trial and error.** I'm prepared to invest a year or more, if needed.\n\nIMO, the most solid information you can get comes from books written by ADHD specialists respected in the medical field. I really appreciate Dr. Hallowell, and found Driven to Distraction (or the more recent Delivered from Distraction) very helpful. He devotes chapters to medication where he breaks down the options in very understandable terms. There are others, but I have limited experience so I won't comment.\n\nI think the best thing anyone can do when evaluating meds, is to keep a journal the week before trying any meds, then keep it updated as you try different meds. That's how I'm managing my own medication, since my doc is also pretty detached from the process. I try very hard to control for all variables, by eating, drinking, sleeping the same day-to-day, and only introducing one change at a time, giving it a while to \"settle\" before introducing another change.\n\nAt this point, I'm 100% sure that Vyvanse helps me way more than it causes problems. But Vyvanse is expensive, so I'm looking into alternatives. My first shot was generic Adderall, but I reacted poorly to it. It helps me focus but makes me feel \"dirty\" and numb. My next step is trying generic dexedrine, since I suspect the levoamphetamine component of Adderall may be to blame for my bad experience."

Adderall does work in the sense of helping me to focus. It works quite well in fact. But it doesn’t outweigh the negatives. If I haven’t taken in it in a while, it can make me almost zombie like. When not being a zombie, I hate to say it, but I’m ratchet. Vyvanse is much more consistent and steady. I typically take in when I wake up, and I try to only take it M-F when I’m at work.   \n\nThe biggest downside to Vyvanse in the price.

Saturation is unlikely to occur at therapeutic doses due to its high-capacity enzymatic process; however, at doses greater than 130 to 150 mg, saturation of enzymatic hydrolysis can be seen resulting in decreased levels and suggesting reduced potential for toxicity in an overdose...\n\nLisdexamfetamine undergoes first pass metabolism in the digestive tract and is then entirely metabolized by lysine cleavage in the bloodstream, which is a rate-limiting step.  Your body produces a limited amount of the enzyme required to cleave the molecule, which means that after a certain point, you will no longer gain any benefit from more ldx and it will just be excreted in urine. This is also significant because it means it is impossible to access the amphetamine content of ldx without taking the drug orally -- you can't snort it, or whatever the kids do these days, since it wouldn't enter your bloodstream that way.\n\n> Vyvanse is an inactive prodrug called lisdexamfetamine dimeslyate. It contains 100% dextroamphetamine and 0% levoamphetamine.\n\nThis is a bit misleading btw, accounting for the methyl groups lisdexamfetamine is converted to around 29% dextroamphetamine by weight, meaning that if you are taking 70mg vyvanse, you are getting just over 20mg of dextroamphetamine throughout the day. \n\nEdit: thanks for updating! Seems like a good representation :)"

    "comment": "It would be more accurate to say that Vyvanse contains a methylated form of dextroamphetamine. When reading Vyvanse contains dextroamphetamine one may think it works the same as dextroamphetamine. It doesn't. They have different half-lifes and different onset. Depending on how your body breaks down Vyvanse it may be less effective. It also should last longer and have a smoother come down.\n\nI am seeing posts stating Vyvance is the time released version. It isn't. Time released drugs are the drug with an added mechanism to titration the drug into your body at a slower rate. The effects of Vyvanse last longer because this prodrug of dextroamphetamine is processed differently in your body.\n\nAside from creating a new patentable drug since adderall was going off patent, Vyvanse was also created as a way to cut down on amphetamine abuse. If you crush up vyvance and insulate it you won't feel much since it is inactive. \n\nReplacing Vyvanse with Dextroamphetamine is not like replacing oranges with oranges. Maybe like replacing oranges with tangerines. Some might like the sweeter taste of tangerines, some may like the tarter taste of oranges. Some may prefer oranges because they are larger and more filling. It's a matter of preference. Some might buy oranges because they are cheaper.\n\nSome might like the quicker onset of dextroamphetamine and the fact that it has more punch. Some may like the gentler come down of Vyvance and the longer duration. Some might buy dextroamphetamine because it's cheaper with thier insurance."

I got a bit lightheaded, so maybe it was a blood pressure thing, but I don't know. I just felt weird and bad, it's kind of hard to explain it.\n\n\nFunny you mention that - I've just switched to Adderall a couple of days ago because the Vyvanse is so expensive, but I've been having the same problem with feeling depressed while on that, almost exactly as you describe. My mood lifts about 6 hours later as the med wears off. I drank some coffee with it today to see if it that would help. It's helped the depression, but I'm not really feeling the med itself either, so there's that. \n\n\nMaybe try to cut down on the coffee? You could experiment and see if doing that and maybe even stopping the coffee makes any difference. I love coffee, but Vyvanse was amazing and I'd rather have the effectiveness and productivity I had with it than the coffee. I just wish it was more affordable, lol."

I was diagnosed back in the nineties, when ADD was new and hip and the Ritallin flowed from the pharmacies like a river of  the pink Brittney Spears spiders which would one day haunt my dreams.\n\nI think my dosage was too high, and that Ritallin wasn't for me at all. I don't remember the events very clearly, but I definitely remember purposefully spitting my pills in the toilet because I hated them so much. Anyway, assumed I didn't have ADD after all and moved forward with my life. \n\nAnyway... It turns out that when you have undiagnosed, untreated, ADHD-PI, you tend to develop coping mechanisms to get by in life, many of which can be unhealthy.  My life eventually became a house of cards constructed of unhealthy coping mechanisms.  I became a really shady person. I'd lie/cheat/steal to appear more productive, and hide my impulsive and addictive habits of which I felt ashamed. \n\nAnyay... long story short my house of cards eventually collapsed, and I woke up to what is going on in my life. Now I'm getting treated more effectively, and trying to put my life back together a little more solidly. \n\nIt just makes me wonder what direction my life would have headed had I been treated effectively from an early age.  We can't change the past however. We can only learn from it to shape right now in to a better future."

I can't tell I'm taking it aside from the lack of anxiety. It's not something I would ever feel tempted to abuse, there's just nothing to encourage that type of behavior from the medication. If there are side effects I can't tell what they are or narrow them down specifically to that medication.  \n\nLife feels pretty smooth from day to day if I medicate properly. Wellbutrin is also a great smoking cessation aid and I believe may help with other addictive substances, but don't quote me fully on that.  \n\nMy personal treatment plan opinion is to take as few medications as possible to achieve the best quality of life. I'm over the whole stage of feeling like I'm less than a person because I need medications to function; that's like being mad at your car because it needs oil, or air in the tires.

    "comment": "So I noticed guanfacine wasn't on the list you had tried. Its used to treat ADHD and high heart rate. Could be worth trying as it treats you're other symptom. \n\nI think cutting the caffeine might be needed here. You could try getting it from sources like tea that have other health benefits and are generally drunk slower so you don't have sudden spikes like you would with coffee or tablets.\n\nIs it possible you have a sleep issue? Many ADHDers get poor sleep. I use magnesium for sleep jerks and melatonin to help me get to sleep when I am restless and tired. I know that I was initially on too high a dose of meds and that combined with my fatigue disorder, caused symptoms similar to yours. Good sleep is different for everyone. Plus you just had surgery so quality rest is needed now more than ever. Finding ways to improve my sleep has made my ADHD more managable without meds and when I do take meds, I can take a lower dose when well rested. \n\nI also used to get worse ADHD symptoms when I was iron difficient, plus feeling tired, unable to get out of bed and so foggy. While generally asymptomatic unless very low, iron difficiencies are very common and I even had a bunch of weird body aches that I thought were injuries magically go away - and my heart rate dropped! (I will also add that most people the north of the northern hemispere have a vitamin D deficiency so a blood test to check for anything minor like this could be a good idea!) It was a single blood test to start getting it sorted out."

One must always be doing something new, as old things become boring quick.\n\nI didn’t just apply this to chores but to multiple aspects of my life such as college and my job. It has allowed me to turn what would otherwise be a hindrance into a great source of efficiency and productivity."

    "comment": "Depends on the situation. If I am at work I will juggle 6 to 7 different tasks at once. I will work like crazy on one until I hit a snag or a rate limiting step then I will immediately hop to another one and repeat the process.\n\nUsing this method I often finish my tasks way ahead of schedule.\n\nAt home I have a “chore day” set aside where I have about 10 different things I have to do. One of them for example is vacuuming the whole house. I will not for example vacuum the whole house all at once, instead I’ll do 1/3rd of it, get bored, then go do some other chore and come back and do another 1/3rd again.\n\nI’ve had a great amount of success with this."

    "comment": "I have tried like every stimulant and combination of stimulants there is. Evekeo is what my doctor prescribed me about 5 years ago or so and I haven’t looked back. It’s really smooth in terms of coming on and going off. I can take it at 4:30 or 5:00 pm and I can still go to sleep at 11:00 or so no problem. Vyvanse makes a horrible crash. With that or adderall xr you really have to have an afternoon dose of something just to help with the crash that occurs. So I currently take Adzenys in the morning and evekeo in the late afternoon. Evekeo would be a good option. Regular adderall keeps me up really late if I take it in the late afternoon."

    "comment": "I’ve been on every ADHD medication I can think of, and the best by far for me has been Vyvanse.\n\nIf you’re not aware, Vyvanse is Lisdexamfetamine. It’s a pro-drug, meaning that the drug itself isn’t active but that your body metabolizes it into a drug that is. In this case, it metabolizes into l-Lysine and d-Amphetamine. The latter is the active compound, and from my understanding you can think of it as roughly equivalent to Adderall.\n\nBecause the active compound in Vyvanse is created by your body at a fixed rate, it’s marketed as “abuse-resistant”. I’m not worried about abuse (like I suspect everyone here, I often forget to take it entirely!), but that means that I “come up” more slowly, “stay up” longer, and “come down” more slowly. I only have to take it once per day, and feel about the same all day.\n\nI’m not sure if it’s possible to “overdose” on Vyvanse alone. Other drugs taken with it can increase or decrease both the effect of the drug and the speed that you metabolize it - but from personal experience, if it’s noon and I don’t think I’ve taken my Vyvanse I take my Vyvanse. The worst side effect I’ve ever experienced from it is insomnia, and that was only on days where I took two by mistake - obviously *very* rare, but honestly that’s the only way I’d know that I’d taken two.\n\nI also keep my dosage as low as possible, and generally don’t take it on weekends. My goal in that is to avoid building tolerance. Stimulants - especially amphetamines - increase the long-term risk of cardiovascular issues, and that’s not something I need any help increasing :). By skipping weekends and regularly trying to drop my dosage a bit at a time, I’ve kept from having to increase my dosage or augment with Adderall (as my doctor has suggested as a possibility in the past). I’m 40, have been on Vyvanse for about a decade now, and my current dosage is 60mg. It’s been 40mg, 50mg, or 60mg since I originally reached a stable therapeutic dose. When it’s 60mg I want to drop it down, and take longer “breaks”. When it’s 40mg, I start to experience focus issues at work after a few weeks. 50mg is the sweet spot :)"
