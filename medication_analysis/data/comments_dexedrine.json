It is lesser known and I think it‚Äôs actually older. One of  the reasons it‚Äôs  not as commonly prescribed  It has a higher chance of abuse  , pretty much just due to the fact that it lacks some of the side effects Adderall has.    \n\nIf ur still considering it I highly recommend to try switching , it  should   definitely be a bit better in terms of the cardio side effects, but keep in mind both medicines are still mostly composed of the same primary  ingredient   So who knows  how big the difference will be for you .

I'd stick with the Vyvanse program and then tell doctor it's expensive and making symptoms worse (if it is) then from there he would prescribe something else, possibly Dexedrine.

It‚Äôs really just not that common I think, and for some reason has more abuse potential than Adderall?

If you look at the ratings for the two drugs on Drugs.com, it gets a much higher rating than Adderall. I think the problem may be that it was synthesized in 1937,and developed a bad rep along the way that lingers.  Other formulations, like Adderall, are modifications that usually don't work as well. \n\nYou may have to find a doctor, usually a psychiatrist, to prescribe it for you.  Once prescribed, you can often get a family doctor to continue with medicatoon maintenance .  \n\nIt's worth the trouble in terms of an improved life.  The more people insist on it, the more available it will become.\n\nIt's so stupid to have to jump thru hoops or educate your doctors. But I suspect they know it's available. Your best bet is a psychiatrist or a psychiatric nurse practitioner."

Drug companies tinker with it , re-brand it, and push doctors to prescribe it, even if it's then very expensive and inferior.  I would not be surprised if drug companies are the problem, bc it is certainly available, Walgreens and Publix in Florida may have to order for you, but they will. Probably the same in other states."

I can still get sleepy while it's in effect, but overall it clears my head and helps keep intrusive thoughts out. \n\nMy doc decided I should try Adderall about 3 years ago.   \nI tried it for one day - I felt like I was moving through syrup and could barely see what was in front of me.   \nAt work - I sat at my desk for 3 hours. Just sat - no thinking, no buzzing, no browsing the internet, not even getting work done - just sat. I did not realize 3 hours had passed until someone came to my office and snapped me out of it. I had no realization that 3 hours had passed. When I got home I sat in the driveway for 20 mins before my wife came out and knocked on the window - I had no idea that time had passed.   \nIt was frightening.    \nI have not touched it since. \n\nI'll repeat - All this is my personal, individual, not to be taken as how it would affect anyone else - experience with 2 different ADD meds."

    "comment": "The FDA recommended age range for a medication particularly a stimulant like dextroamphetamine which has literally been used in adults for the better part of a century, really has no relationship to the ages of the people who doctors actually prescribe it to.  Before it was repurposed  for treating ADHD, Dexedrine had never even been marketed or prescribed as a drug that should be prescribed to children.  Some doctors simply will not prescribe Dexedrine to patients because it is much more potent than other ADHD medications and it is perceived as more readily abusable.  Despite the FDA recommended age range, it is likely that modern doctors would be more likely to prescribe Dexedrine to adults and less likely to prescribe it to children given that weaker stimulants called methylphenidates are typically used in children rather than amphetamines, although with the introduction of Vyvanse to the market this has changed but only because mg for mg Vyvanse is a much less potent preparation of dextroamphetamine than drugs like Adderall or Dexedrine.  If a doctor is going to going to prescribe dextroamphetamine to a child, they are going to do so in the form of Vyvanse which can‚Äôt be abused and only needs to be taken once a day.  In short Dexedrine is very unlikely to ever be used in children under 16, but it‚Äôs recommended dosing range hasn‚Äôt been updated for about four decades."

And no more than 500mg nac with the medication  because  it can also reduce  the effects. Basically it slows down certain processes like glutamate rest the brain and repairs them, sort of like rebooting the brain. This is exactly how ketamine therapy works for depression. Dxm is a viable alternative since insurance does not cover ketamine therapy. TAKE THE dxm and nac when your winding down,.

So while he was fun it came with a cost. \n\nAlso when I got older his inability to listen to me or be there for me emotionally did create distance between us. I no longer wanted the fun parent, I wanted the emotionally caring and socially aware parent. I now can accept my dad for his fun and flaws as an adult but it took a long time to get there and it would have been easier on our family if he was open to treatment"

My intuitive answer to your question is to keep on keeping on and weather out the phase‚Ä¶for both of you. You‚Äôre still finding your new normal on meds and she‚Äôs adjusting to changes from her perspective. She doesn‚Äôt have the words to kindly and accurately communicate her feelings‚Ä¶and her feelings are new and raw. Take what she says with a huge grain of salt. My girl sometimes says she likes mommy more but I know that‚Äôs because mommy just got home from work and she likes mommy more *right now*. Your daughter loves and likes you, dad. Just put in your emotional armor for a few days or weeks and ride it out. Keep on playing, keep on loving, keep on reading and being there. \n\nAlso, you are still your authentic self on meds. You have made a choice for you and those around you. I‚Äôm excited for you. Good luck!"

Don‚Äôt give that up just to make her happy. It‚Äôs good that you love your daughter and you want to make her happy, but this isn‚Äôt the way.

And 4 year olds are sometimes just smart enough and selfish enough to say the most hurtful things when they don‚Äôt get what they want. \n\nChances are the dex makes you a much better father and only somewhat worse friend. You‚Äôll adjust and your daughter will adjust, even if it feels like she lost her best friend. Talk to her about what‚Äôs going on, and also about saying hurtful things. In any case your partner is probably thrilled to have a new co-parent. \n\nI highly recommend taking days off or with a lower dose whenever you can just to keep your tolerance in check. For you and your family, maybe one day a weekend. But this is tricky because that day will often be lower energy, not great for dealing with kids. Expect this to take weeks. It‚Äôll be a process right along with process of raising kiddos, and you and your family‚Äôs needs will continue to evolve."

This may sound harsh (but I have kids as well) but you have other responsibilities to yourself and your daughter that go well beyond catering to her 4yo needs for a family clown or a friend.\n\nShe will grow older and she will mature and even if it is difficult now, the change you notice in yourself is a change she needs to get accustomed to as well. \n\nUltimately, I am sure that will not remember the time she was four but she will remember the much better dad and the much better lessons she learned from a father who was not riddled with anxiety (because she *will* pick up on that too, and those are lessons you won't even realize you are giving her until its too late).\n\nYour concern is commendable and shows how much you love her but imo, she needs to become a happy a balanced teen/young adult/adult... not just a happy 4yo."

I noticed starting people would point out certain things and I would have no idea and then begin to hyper focus on the thoughts of what did I do wrong even if it was something like my mood was different (happens to the best of us). I think it‚Äôs a lot of trial and error with meds and finding the perfect dosage but you sound like your recognizing the issue and caring to the point of asking others opinion, I mean that alone shows your awareness of something not being quite right and the motivation to change either meds or dosage but of course consulting with your doctor and having follow ups if possible. I find Dexedrine (for me) can bring out some emotional changes (agitation, lethargy, sometimes flat effect) and if my sleep or daily schedule is off then most people close to me will begin to point out if something seems off, then I know to take a break for a a day or take a little less the next day. Very easy to get stuck on tasks with it so I find a list or setting timers helps quite a bit. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to do that and you gotta cut yourself some slack, it‚Äôs progress towards your mental health which is always very very important. Took a while for me to figure out timing and how it would effect the rest of my day.

    "comment": "If you don't need to take the meds every day, take them only when you have to work. And explain it to your kid. Explain what ADHD is, say that your regular adhd brain is a bit similar to hers. Always want to play and explore stuff. And it's okay to some point in life, when you are still a kid, but as you grow up you are supposed to get a bit more organised and serious. And your brain just can't switch to the \"adult mode\" itself, so you have meds to do it for you. So you can be a succesfull adult, and be able to take care of the house, be able to work (so there is money for food and toys and other stuff). If you don't take your meds your brain switches back to the exploring and playful mode. Explain it to her and say that you won't take your meds on your days off, and she will have her dad on playful-mode when dad doesn't need to do any important adult stuff that needs him focused and more serious. \n\n\nIf you like explaining things visually (which is ofc good with most kids), I would imagine this as a brain that has a lightswitch that has 3 positions. Up, middle, and down. Up is colorful flashing bright lights and a discoball. Middle is a regular warm white light. Down is complete darkness. Colorful flashing lights and discoballs are cool if you want to have fun and play and dance, but it's hard to focus with them on when you are trying to learn, work or do something important that requires focus. Regular white light is a default setting for most people. It's comfortable to work, talk with people, learn things and focus. Darkness can be a bit scary, you barely see anything and you can mistake something not scary for a danger. \n\nMost peoples brains are just white warm light by default. Some people, like you, have it set on disco lights, that make it uncomfortable to work with etc. So you have to take meds that will switch your mind to a calm warm white. But that's not a party mood anymore. And there are people whose minds are darkness and they struggle to put a light on. So they take meds to have the white light and life comfortably."

Talk to her, and ask lots of questions. Find out what exactly is making her feel the way she is feeling. Try to explain your change in words she can understand. Maybe using things like naps and crankiness or bath time, or whatever she doesn't like at the time. Sometimes we have to do things to make ourselves better, and that takes some hard work.

Your brain and body will become accustomed to the effects (this is why many people increase their doses over time, as the same dose feels like it does less after long enough), and you will notice the suppressed parts of your personality come back, although they will still be regulated more than before (which is a good thing).\n\nFrom someone who has taken breaks using the same meds as you, and has had periods of time where my pill discipline was sloppy‚Äîyou will definitely feel the same personality 'dampening' if you ever take breaks and start back up again.

IE if you miss a day or two in a row, no big deal, but if you miss a few days in a row several times over the course of a week or two, the extremes between impulsivity and dullness will become more and more pronounced.

She‚Äôs 4. \n4) I just came back from family visits Christmas, and I can tell you that my family also doesn‚Äôt like me ‚Äúon meds‚Äù as much - I‚Äôm less fun, more anxious, more assertive, (I think) much better at socializing and also setting boundaries.  I don‚Äôt drink as much as I used too - maybe this makes me boring at Christmas.  BUT -  my relationship with my husband is way better because of the meds. I can‚Äôt even begin to describe how much better of a life and household partner I am than I was 10 years ago. No comparison.  Do your meds help you be a better husband and father? Not the fun one, but the actual take care of hard adulting things? If yes, I‚Äôd say focus on being a good partner to your spouse and the two of you can support each other while your daughter ping pongs between which parent is her favourite on any given week.  \nHang in there!"

    "comment": "This sounds so much like my current situation and I'm not sure the best advice. I used to be the overly fun parent before I was medicated. It was easy to be silly and make up games with my kid, but I struggled with other aspects of life (nothing too bad, I wasn't gonna get fired or go hungry or anything). I got my meds and felt amazing! Everything that appeared to be easy for other people was getting easier for me too, but I was less fun and less spontaneous.\n\nFlash forward a few years and there's 2 more kids. They're young and bouncy and remind me of how I used to be. They don't have problems with school so no worries there. My chief concern is: will being a more serious parent mean they won't \"like\" me later in life and won't want me to be around except for holidays? And I dont mean \"like\" here as being best friends with my kids but I don't want them to avoid the hard ass with no imagination.\n\nI think too many people are \"waving off\" the thoughts of your daughter just cause she's 4. Her feelings are very valid and it's probably an observation others have made but haven't mentioned to you directly."

I just became well - just existing - yet everything else was great with it dealing with my ADHD. I ended up back on Adderall and felt my self again in two weeks and kept up the productiveness but it was actually my daughter mentioning to me about one month thing that I was different and not in the best way (less empathetic yet emotional on things I should be and not emotional where I should have been) that made me really notice it \n\nI know Aus doesn‚Äôt do Adderall but speak to your doc about this if you personally are bothered by it about trying other stuff out.

This is NOT what your daughter needs!! She needs a daddy that is strong, responsible and happy with himself. Able to provide for her in a way that she needs. \n\nShe's 4. She doesn't know what she's saying. She doesn't know what's going on. She could no possibly understand the situation and she doesn't have to. I'm sorry you are going through this but you need to take care of YOU so that you can take care of her. \n\nAlso, not sure if you've \"settled in\" to your prescription or not but you should be taking a day or two off the meds every week. So if you work weekdays, maybe the weekends can be a \"break\" from your meds (obviously discuss with your Dr first) and have some freeform fun days with your daughter. \n\nBest of luck!

I‚Äôve posted quite a few things in the past on here - but never in a million years did I expect so many likes and comments. Really shows how compassionate folks can be when they see someone struggling with something.\n\nOver the last few days I‚Äôve continued with the Dex but focused really hard on the relationship with my daughter. While we‚Äôve not perhaps had quite the level of silly fun we‚Äôve been able to in the past, I‚Äôve also been able to give her experiences that my lack of mental energy and focus, and general disorganisation, would never have usually allowed. I‚Äôve also been able to unearth a little more silliness in myself, so all in all I think I‚Äôll continue for now.\n\nA couple of other thoughts. I‚Äôve found that keeping my caffeine intake up a bit helps to retain my sociability, whereas cutting it out intensifies the ‚Äúseriousness‚Äù side effect that comes with Dex. Secondly, I have a great relationship with my doc, and am considering trying a methylphenidate based med for a little while, just to see if I have any luck. I tend to hear less positive things for this class of drugs on forums, but the studies suggest they‚Äôre equally as effective, so I will give them a go.\n\nOn a final note, while I agree that she‚Äôs 4 and everything should be taken with a massive grain of salt, one of the reasons it hurt so badly is that I could already feel that I was different to my prior self, but I‚Äôd prioritised my symptom relief over that niggling feeling. That led to a tremendous sense of guilt, even if is still the right thing to do. I also will always listen to what my girls tell me. While she‚Äôs only 4, there can still be truth or things to learn from what she shares, and nothing is more important than words from either of my daughters or my wife.\n\nAnyway, thanks so much everyone. I can‚Äôt reply to everything as I‚Äôll probably get RSI, but you‚Äôre great folks for chipping in."

I'm sure you will find an appropriate way to explain that you are still the same loving Dad, but your medicine helps you do some of the boring grown up stuff so you are able to have more fun. \nIf she understands what is going on and feels part of the process of helping Daddy, I'm sure it will be a lot easier and everyone will adjust. \nIf anything it is a good reminder of the importance of not taking our children for granted and making time to be goofy ü§™\nI don't have children but have had to try and balance benefits of meds (I'm also taking dexamphetamine and Vyvanse) with keeping irritation and anxiety in check. \nMy partner sometimes remarks that I seem much better in myself on meds, but forgets this when I snap his head off when the irritation catches up on me. \nThese meds aren't perfect but it helps if those around us are able to support us and cut us some slack.

    "comment": "Besides the main thing i want to reiterate that everyone else haa been enphasizing that you on meds isnt bad especially if your well being improved.. and ur daughter will surely adjust, i wanted to give insight on something i do!\n\nI have 5mg instant release available for me to take if i happen to need it after my 15mg extended release. I dont take it every day because my responsibilities vary each day as well as my reaction to my meds, so sometimes i end up saving a few extras.\nOn days where I want that goofy, hyper, albeit somewhat fatigued self, and want to take a break from the side effects, i do not take my extended release. I have these IR tablets available if I get too out of it, or get any particular withdrawal symptom. So on these days sometimes I will take 2 5mg IRs , or 1. They help me so much when i want a med break.\nFor me, I tend to be ultra sensetive to side effects of my meds so these breaks have many purposes. If you do not feel that the break is right for you, I have some assurance for you.\nYoure most likely adjusting to the meds. At first when I started to take my new ones I felt kind of different socially and mentally in that I had less to say, almost feeling robotic and a little on edge. Now as I adjust I feel more like my normal self, its just that the meds pick me up and guide me when I need to get things done. You can always adjust your meds to find a sweet spot between productivity and minimal change/side effect too.\nSecond of all, you are an amazing parent! She is very young and, like others said, probably wont remember what she said very soon. She definitely loves you no matter what and I know you will be able to find other ways that you guys can bond on the meds as well, the meds really open your mind to new ideas since they help you think so clearly:)\n\nBest of luck, I know words like those can hit hard, but she is a young child and they sometimes even say things they dont fully mean, as well as forget what they say!"

It is a struggle‚Ä¶hard‚Ä¶sometimes to focus and do what other people can just‚Ä¶do. My husband is luckily incredibly patient and I and also lucky in that occasionally I hyper focus on housework/organization so I just cycle. I‚Äôm only planning on having 1 (maybe eventually fostering) but I never realized that my willingness to just sit and play with her might possibly be attributed to adhd in a roundabout way. Again, thank you for posting as the decision between medicating and not was weighing on me and nothing was helping me decide. I‚Äôll be silly at least for a few more years haha. As my one therapist said‚Ä¶I‚Äôve made it this far in life without meds. \nMy other therapist mentioned there were medications that weren‚Äôt stimulants. I‚Äôm not familiar with this one but I‚Äôm hoping that there are maybe other ones your doctor can suggest if you bring this issue up to him. \nSending good vibes your way! Your daughter loves you either way! And while maybe you won‚Äôt be as ‚Äúsilly‚Äù, maybe you‚Äôll be more active or be able to do other more structured things with her.

That's a pretty bold statement coming from a kid.  \n\nMy meds definitely make me get caught up in hyperfocusing on things other than the people around me so I can relate to that, but for some people they actually get moody and snap at others if they're interrupted or when the meds wear off in the evenings.  If this is happening you need to acknowledge it because there are ways to lessen those side effects without quitting the medication altogether.  Dosage reduction, taking smaller taper down doses throughout the day, eating more in the afternoon/evening, etc can all help even out the comedown.  \n\nHowever the advice others have given (that your daughter probably just wants you to be crazy freewheeling daddy) is on the nose.  As long as your meds aren't making you uptight and cranky, there's no problem and you should continue taking care of your mental health.  She's a kid; she'll adjust."

So you still have focus, but your less INTENSE PRODUCTIVE focused\n\nThis will work better if you're on dex tablets not Dex SR.\n\nLike if 10mg dex is your morning dose, you could try 5 or 7.5, and then take your normal afternoon 10mg 2nd dose if you had morning hangouts with her\n\nEveryone here has good advice but I personally don't enjoy being on my full dose of Vyvanse when I'm just chillin.

There's tons of craft kits for various ages. You may not be as off the wall creative but craft projects are a structured event that should be easy for you to get involved.

For myself, I've found the type of medication affects this a lot. I'm currently on vyvanse and it's less of an issue as compared to short acting or dexedrine spansules, and I tried adderall several years ago which affected me negatively like that really badly. I also know for myself, this feeling is often the worst in the evening when \"crashing\" from the medication.\n\nFor me personally, I don't take my medication every day now, and take it strategically (i.e., never take it on the weekends, don't take it most days of the week). I try to manage my adhd with exercise, timers, and lists, whether I'm on or off medication, but I think the days without medication help me feel like myself and reconnect with my goofier side! If you're feeling OK without medication every day you could try that approach and plan extra adventures with your kids on those days. Also, maybe getting some exercise in the evening can help with the medication wear off and rejuvenate yourself/clear your head. I know for myself transitioning out of work mode and into home/fun mode takes time and doesn't happen automatically, so giving myself a ritual like working out or going on a walk when I'm done with work for the day really helps.\n\nAlso, totally agree with the other comments that kids can be harsh and it might not mean too much, or be too related to the medication and could just be a phase! I totally understand that that would hurt my feelings though. But if you are feeling robotic and less like yourself that definitely might be a sign to change how you use it (like I do, strategically) or trying a different medication or dose."

This is a perfect response. \nI'm a ps teacher and my kids noticed when i went on meds too, it wasn't so much a negative thing but they definately notice changes in personality of the people they trust. I had a comment from a girl (4yo) who's a bit talkative saying she likes me now because I \"talk for a long time\" like I don't get distracted and wander off to other children ect. It wasn't apparent to me that I did that until she mentioned it. Connecting with children can be difficult and you have to find a way that works for yourself and the child, if that means taking a different approach entirely then that's that."

It‚Äôs a trade off that I have to live with. It‚Äôs a real thing I struggle with because like OP I‚Äôm less myself medicated and less the free thinker."

All I‚Äôd add is you have to do a cost/benefit analysis in totality. Ie, sounds like you are much a much better father/husband/provider and, most importantly, have markedly better self-esteem with meds. So the scales seem overwhelming tilted towards meds. \n\nYou can always be ‚Äúfun and spontaneous dad‚Äù when you take a break 1 or 2x/wk. \n\nThat‚Äôd what I do. \n\nYou are super lucky to have found such an effective combo and success with meds.

My dad was always the fun parent, and at times made questionable choices. We are really similar and I felt like he was the only one I could connect to in my family. Most of that was likely similarly presenting adhd, we both seek dopamine from food, stay up until 2am, spend hours a day watching movies, will drive for 8 hours straight and enjoy it, spend most of our time in our own heads, and make choices that my mom doesn‚Äôt understand. My brother was diagnosed with adhd when he was little but for him it mostly caused quick intense anger. I‚Äôve recently realized that having adhd would make sense of my entire life and since it is often inherited, both of us kids having it makes it more likely that my dad does too. As I got older I found it harder to connect with him as he is so out of touch with his emotions and conversation was rarely something he was interested in. Sorry this comment is so long, I know you probably don‚Äôt care but you totally just helped me realize this, thank you!"

Or, it could be that she got frustrated with him or embarrassed in front of him about something and instead of being able to understand those feelings, her best approximation is ‚Äúwant a new dad‚Äù. \n\n\nWhen I was between 2 & 5, here are some of the weird things I did or said:\n\n- ‚Äúmommy when are you going to die so I can marry daddy?‚Äù (Cringe!!!!)\n\n- I wouldn‚Äôt let my dad come into my room or even say good night to me one night because he farted earlier and it smelled bad and I was upset about it. \n\n- i made my parents a card, and on the inside there was a heart with a big X through it because apparently I was mad at them \n\nSmall humans just don‚Äôt know what to do with big feelings sometimes, not to mention understanding where those feelings come from. It‚Äôs always good to talk to kiddos about their feelings in simple terms ‚Äúis there something daddy is doing that you don‚Äôt like, or are you just in a mommy mood?‚Äù  ‚ÄúIt makes daddy sad that you said that, because he loves you so much and wants to be your best daddy in the whole world!

    "comment": "I wrote my response last night and thinking about it more, I wanted to emphasize the transition out of work mode comment! That's actually a huge need for me, and my dad said a similar thing about raising me and my sister (he's not on medication but totally ADHD). I feel much more socially awkward or short or emotionally distant if I don't get a little transition time, even though in the moment I often don't feel like I need that at all. For me this could either be a little walk, or a proper workout, or a \"nap\" where I don't really fall asleep but just veg for like 10 or 15 minutes. I think that's a common thing with ADHD in general (hard time set shifting), and kind of made worse by medication for some people, and not super intuitive. So yeah, trying to give yourself a little intentional transition time out of responsibility mode and into bonding/playing with your kid mode might have a big impact on your mood as you transition from one role to the other! I have a 2 month old baby and I'm realizing how important that is for me right now (I also appreciate how limited time is, so doing that in a way to give your partner a break, like going on a walk with your kids or something might work?)\n\nThere's really great advice in here! I kind of want to share this with a friend who is nervous about starting medication, cause you can see how varied peoples responses are and how there are so many strategies to manage any unpleasant side effects through playing with type/dose/timing, or behavior around the medication."

    "comment": "I think you‚Äôve kind of answered your own question there. You are a better dad, and a better partner, when you take your medication. \n\nYour daughter is only little, she doesn‚Äôt see or understand the organisational or behind the scenes stuff that goes into being a parent, so she doesn‚Äôt take that into account. But believe me, one day, and probably soon, she will start to notice when those things *do* go wrong all the time - the being embarrassed for always turning up to your clubs late, the social consequences of having an unreliable/unorganised/constantly late parent, not feeling like you can go to your dad for help because they have too much on their plate already or can‚Äôt deal with ‚Äúserious stuff‚Äù, etc., and that may well damage your relationship in an even worse and more long term manner. I love my parents (never diagnosed or medicated but for sure have ADHD), and I have ADHD myself (diagnosed and medicated), but I have so many painful memories of being mortified about them forgetting to take me somewhere, or forgetting to pick me up from school, or being late, or being embarrassed of my messy home, or them not being able to help me in the way I needed, or promising to help and not managing to keep that promise, and those feelings have had a huge effect on both my childhood and my adult life, and it‚Äôs hard not to feel some resentment, even though it‚Äôs not their fault. If you can do something to mitigate some of that, do it. \n\nThe imagination and playing about can be fixed, adapted, explored - the fundamental functioning as a human being without medication can‚Äôt. You want to explore her hobbies with her, that‚Äôs amazing! What a fun process to find something you both enjoy doing together! Maybe it‚Äôs a bit different from before but it can still be fun! You may even have a better attention span to be able to dedicate your time to those activities with her and that‚Äôs so invaluable. You‚Äôre still the same person, the fun is still in there, it‚Äôs just might be coming out differently. That‚Äôs a complicated concept for a little kid, so to her it‚Äôs just ‚Äúdaddy is a different person‚Äù. But she doesn‚Äôt fully understand and she‚Äôs just saying what comes into her head - kids can be brutal but their perception is not always accurate. \n\nDon‚Äôt sacrifice your wife, your relationship, or your ability to be a good, reliable, safe father, for the whims of a 4 year old child who doesn‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs happening and just wants daddy to be a goofy clown right this second. Kids find change difficult, and bear in mind that your daughter may well also have ADHD or similar given the strong genetic link so might find it even more of a struggle, but luckily they also have shorter memories for these kinds of things at this age. You can find a way round it. Ask her what it is she misses or wants to do and work out some solutions, try some new stuff out, have fun!"

I also take a low dose of SSRI to offset the irritation/ anxiety when the meds start to leave my system as I am a fast metaboliser, as soon as dopamine starts to drop my serotonin also drops causing the irritation and mood dip. \nI have only taken dex with Vyvanse so can't speak about it's effects by itself, I've heard of some folk experiencing emotional blunting with methylphenidate, or dex alone. \nVyvanse seems to work well in this regard where I am better able to regulate my emotions without feeling blunt or numb, if anything I am very much in touch with them and there is more clarity in what I'm feeling."

I didn' t need to do research about it (hence I don't know the answer to this) because I took ginseng only when totally clear of all meds.

I immediately struggled with time management and motivation, catching the bus, going to my classes, being social there, wrapping my brain around life. I really wasnt happy with it, and at a higher dose it made me feel like my brain was hurtling like a train out of control. My best friend, also with adhd, took dex, and while it really helped with their productivity, it made their moods spiral out of control and gave them insane anxiety and paranoia.\n\nI got on vyvanse last year and it's been such an awesome improvement to my day to day life and gives me so so so much more control over my passions and career. Even though dex is another form of vyvanse, vyvanse helps massively, while dex did *very* little.\n\nI was taking Seroquel for insomnia for a year or two and it really seemed like the holy grail for me, but then I went off it and had the most insane insomnia I've ever experienced where I was lucky to get 3 hours of sleep a night for a month, and it turned out there was a 1$billion lawsuit against it's manufacturers for being a terrible, terrible drug prescribed willynilly for insomnia despite being an antipsychotic, and people can have *years* of severe sleep issues after stopping it. So! I wouldn't necessarily feel like this is the holy grail you've missed out on. People's bodies and brains are different. Medications can affect you differently, and somebody mentioned a reason why dex isn't given as much these days down below. There's a chance that dex could do not much, or way too much.

    "comment": "I‚Äôm going to hijack your post for a rant of my own. I believe your anger to be misdirected. The fault here does not completely lie with the psychiatrist. Did you know that there is genetic testing available to determine what psychiatric medications are better/worse for treating a whole host of mental illnesses? These tests are by no means perfect but they reduce the possibilities from say 100 treatment options to maybe 50 or even 25. This test, at least for me and the time I took it, was inconclusive for some of the more popular ADHD meds. These tests will improve over time. That improvement is slow going because insurance companies are reluctant to pay for this testing. I have damn good insurance that pays for almost everything, but even my insurance required extra documentation to allow testing. I am classified as somewhat treatment resistant. In my mind, these tests should be done whenever a patient is first diagnosed with any mental illness. If that were the case, sufficient data might be available to pinpoint the right combination of medications for you. Instead, insurance companies are forcing doctors to guess at the best course of treatment. Trial and error. \n\nThere are more genetic tests available that would be very helpful for all kinds of doctors, but insurance companies will not allow them. There are simple blood tests that can diagnose many illnesses, physical and mental, but doctors are not allowed to use them because insurance companies won‚Äôt pay. Doctors are forced to diagnose, in many cases, by relying on patient reported, subjective symptoms. The technology is available to pinpoint some of these diagnoses or eliminate some diagnoses by objective blood, brain, or genetic markers. Just not paid for by insurance."

I did some googling because I knew Vyv wasnt quite the same feeling as Adderall. Found Dex and brought it up to my provider.\n\nWe talked about it. She lowered my Vyvanse dose and prescribed me Dextroamphetamine to take along with it in the morning at the same time. So I get going much quicker now (within \\~30 minutes), which is nice.

The special salt mixture made it a unique product worthy of a patent.  \n  \n At the time, the various salts were marketed to physicians as a type of rudimentary time-release mechanism, extending the duration of action.   \n   \n\nAnd levoamphetamine might extend the duration of dextroamphetamine by competing for metabolic enzymes (levo takes a little longer to metabolize than dextro so it sort of ‚Äúgums up the works‚Äù).   \n\nThey also argued the levo-amphetamine component improved the efficacy of the drug vs dextro-only formulations. In some animal models, for example, Levo-amphetamine is better for hyperactivity symptoms.   \n  \nWith the patent in hand, and the rise in ADHD diagnoses in the 90s, Shire was absolutely printing money.

I used to be fairly overweight and inactive with poor cardiovascular health. I'm on 60mg of vyvanse currently, and I have been cleaning pools for the past year and a half, which is a surprisingly good cardio workout when you do it for 8 hours a day. Throughout this whole time, from being overweight and unmedicated, to overweight and medicated, to where I am now with medication and a fairly healthy and active body, my resting heartrate while sleeping has always stayed around the high 40s and low 50s.

I'm also in Australia, I'm hoping the NDIS inquiry for ADHD will bear some fruit for us in the next few years. \n\nTo be clear, I'm not a medical professional. I'm actually a journalist that writes about biotechnology research among other things. \n\nThat said, and admitting I am only skimming these papers, the first linked paper by Holt et al. doesn't mention anything about controlling for predisposition or lifestyle factors. Research shows people with ADHD are about 70% more likely to develop obesity than the general population, which is a much more important factor in heart health than medication. \n\nThe increases are also very small. 1.7% stroke incidence in prior users compared to 2.1% in daily users, heart failure is 0.7% vs 1.2% and composite risk is 3% compared to 3.9%.\n\nThe second paper by Le Zhang et al. does control for at least 5 factors including age and sex, but I note they have no data on participants' relative diets, exercise habits, or alcohol/tobacco intake, which again are vitally important risk factors for heart disease. \n\nAlso, a 23% increase at the 5 year+ mark sounds significant, but if we apply that to the true risk to the population we go from 6.7 in every 100 people developing CVD to 8.2 per 100. Not a particularly large change.\n\nThe relative increases appear to be quite small in both studies, which I would argue is outweighed by the health benefits of taking medication even if the data is accurate."

    "comment": "Hey man, I got diagnosed at 26. Nearly 27 now and I'm still not stable on the medication, but let me tell you this : ADHD builds a caged fire inside of you. All the dreams you could never chase, the untold number of ideas you could never bring to life, the school and work aspirations you always knew you were capable of but for some reason just couldn't bring to fruition, the work you wanted to put in but couldn't, the years of built up shame from thinking maybe you were just lazy despite knowing you work harder than everybody else - all of that hasn't been let out, but it hasn't gone anywhere. It's all piled up in there, locked in a sophisticated ADHD cage, burning you like a fucking sun. You can probably feel it in your solar plexus. I know I could. And you know that too, because that's exactly why you wrote down this paragraph for a group of strangers to read.\n\nDo you know what happens when you finally unlock that cage? You will explode with motivation and willpower to catch up on everything you missed out and more. All that pent up emotion is just going to act as a propelling force pushing you harder than ever to accomplish everything you ever wanted. And then, without the cage, you will actually, for the first time in your life, be able to do anything you set your mind to.\n\nAnd the best part of it all is, pretty much nobody else around you will have that power to exploit. It's yours and yours only. You've played a quarter of your life in Very Hard mode and you just switched that shit to Easy. Everyone else has been playing on easy all along. Who do you think the better player is going to be?\n\nDon't lose hope. I found my key in dextroamphetamine. 7 months later I'm still not 100% there with finding exactly the drug/dose that works 100%, but I'm getting there, and my life has been changed already. You will find yours. Go get treatment. NOW. At ANY cost. no matter what it takes. And when you do, try every single possible thing there is until you find something that works for you. Pour all your soul into this single task.  This might be the difference between life and a slow and miserable death. I'm sure you can do it, because you are me a year ago, and I did. And what a year it has been."

I didn't, heck, couldn't, get out of bed until 1 or 2pm most days. I had no direction, no purpose. No goals, no..nothing. I thought I was complete and total failure.\n\nI spent my early 20s drinking and partying (sure, looking back now, they were fun... but I hadn't...done anything). I had nothing to show for it. By the time I hit 25, I was done. Toast. Just miserable. \n\nBut things got better over time. \n\nIt hasn't been easy (grad school without meds was a nightmare). It took a few years but I got my shit together over time... starting with the decision that I would do things differently. I didn't get diagnosed until about 16 months ago and I've reached a new level of happiness. Looking back...I never thought I'd be where I am now. \n\nAll of that to say - you're young. You have so much time. You can make this moment the moment that everything changed. You can look back in a few years and be proud that you made the decision to change.

I was stuck in a dead end job, had a shitty apartment, dropped out of college, and watched all the people from my high school going to grad school, buying houses, having beautiful weddings and kids etc. Meanwhile I felt like I wasted my life.

    "comment": "It took me until 29 to realize it was time to tackle my undiagnosed ADHD. I'll be turning 31 in 5 months, I've been prescribed Adderall and I got therapy. The medication, in my own opinion, is what made the difference in my life. \n\nThe trick is that after 1 year of medication I'm fully realizing this is a life long thing. I won't ever get \"better\" I'll just manage to cope with it better. I still feel like a lost wanderer, as I have always felt and its how I continue to feel. The medication and mindful strategies help fit into a day to day routine that is expected of me but even still that's not what happiness means to me. It helps me tame the side of me that offers no value to anyone else.  \n\nI am a separated parent. My relationship had many challenges but in hindsight my untreated ADHD was likely the cause for my inability to recognize a solution. I was 22 when my daughter was born, I was a single father at 25. I dropped out of college 3 times and accumulated a good chunk of pointless student debt. I hate myself for that but it wasn't really my fault. I was the square peg that was being forced into a round hole. I did what everyone else was doing, because I was supposed to. It's what I was told to do. I was told to just carry on. \n\nI've never wanted anything in life. In school my peers had ambitions. They were certain of themselves in a way I didn't understand. I like video games, so I wanted to make video games. That's what I told the adults to satisfy their question. \"I don't know\" wasn't going satisfy the guidance councilor so they could \"help\" me decide what classes to take at 14 years old so I could \"achieve my dreams\" one day. The closer I got to adulthood the more I realized I didn't want any of it. The more I realized I never had any dreams at all. I just wanted to exist and find peace inside myself. \n\nMy diagnosis granted me the privilege of being prescribed Adderall and to avoid the high cost of therapy without my doctors referral. Before that I had found a job that is ultimately pointless but provides me with the necessary funds to maintain a comfortable, but humble life. It's a dead end and that destroys my soul, but it has an employer matched pension, extended health insurance benefits, stock options, rrsp and tax free savings accounts that are matched at 33%. I don't want any of this, but I know others don't have anything close to it and I am thankful. But I still feel lost. I'm just doing what I'm told to do. \n\nI've begun to truly tear down who and what I am. It's been incredibly painful. I think part of ADHD is the unrelenting want for more. The unending \"what if?\", or \"Is this it?\". I think it lies to us, that it tells us we can be anything from it's disconnected place inside us. It's a disability that compares us to everyone else all of the time and wonders why we're not all of them, all at once. \n\nThis isn't to say that I haven't found improvement in my life. I've had to examine what my improvement is for myself, without comparison to anyone else. I've had to find a way to see me through my own eyes and not as a reflection in someone else's. I've had to accept that I won't likely learn to code just because I \"want\" to. I've had to accept that I can't be anything I want to be. I can only be what I am and I have to be ok with that."

I used to kick myself for being \"lazy\" and \"unmotivated.\" I really didn't know how much of a zombie ADHD made me feel like. Now I feel like I have the energy to push myself to do the things I've been wanting to. I've started my business, been painting, exercising, reading for fun.\n\nThe indecisiveness really set me back too, I switched majors like 5 times based on people's advice. I have 2 more years left and I'm determined to complete it. That's what pushed me to get diagnosed. **Go with your gut** on what you want and not your mind. My mind, compromised by everyone's \"wise thoughts,\" was going in a million directions only for me to circle back to what I initially wanted. Think about basics: what tasks you find most joy in, what you seem to excel at, what skills you have that others don't. Try to direct all that towards your next step. Don't despair when your ADHD gets in the way. Follow through with it and believe in yourself and your gut instinct. You were led to your choice, not just because you were interested, but because you ARE capable.\n\nAnother thing: people always say think about the big picture but that always felt daunting and impossible to me. I'm focusing on smaller goals so I don't get overwhelmed. Just take things step by step, week by week, semester by semester. Whatever feels right. Try not to be too upset with any failures, its not your fault. You still gain knowledge from failed classes, and that makes it easier to pass next time!"

I think the number one goal you need right now is exactly that - figure out what you need to be able to slow your thoughts a bit so you can get a breath. Having your brain run that fast for days on end is exhausting!! The two things I use are medication for my ADD (the lowest dose I can take that helps me just enough) and normal mindfulness meditation. The meds will help to slow your neurotransmitters down, and the meditation will help to slow you down even more so that you aren't forced to follow every single stray thought down the rabbit hole of eternal distraction.\n\nI hear you on the despair very much as well. It's a really hopeless, shitty, scary place to be trapped (I don't know how many times I've told myself in anger \"Why can't you just do the NORMAL THINGS everyone else can do?) and it can be scary.\n\nBut trust me you are way ahead of the curve (and pretty self aware as well) if you have as good a grasp on identifying the problem this early.

I was 30 years old when transitioned into a career in the insurance industry. If my first year, I doubled my restaurant industry salary, in my second year, I tripled my restaurant industry salary and State Farm offered me my own agency. \n\nI was diagnosed with autism recently but I had recognized that I had those traits too. \n\nI chose the insurance industry for a reason though. Since I am not college educated, it limited my job prospects and fortunately, in the United States, insurance representatives can easily make six figures selling car, home, and life insurance. I was interested in personal finance (and economics) and I had a restaurant colleague who left the industry and worked as a financial planner.  I met with him and was incredibly underwhelmed with what he did -- it was just an opportunity to sell life insurance products under the guise of it being financial planning and helping to save money. There was little consideration to suitability and obviously, if financial planning and saving money was the primary goal, their financial planning advice was not a good model. \n\nThat was the only exposure I had to the financial planning world and it was a huge turn off. The finance industry has a very broey atmosphere that I did not want to be a part of. I felt that the boring reputation of the insurance industry was particularly attractive due to my ADHD and autism (atmospheres like that help keep me grounded). The average age of an insurance agent is also something like, 58, which to me, meant that many people in the industry probably weren't leveraging data as well as they could be or connecting with millennials. Clearly, the $700 or so investment it cost to get pre-licensed and then licensed paid off and I enjoy working in the insurance industry. \n\nBeing in a workplace where you feel valued is incredibly important and helped give me the self-esteem that I needed to see a psychiatrist and get meds for my ADHD. It felt like I was cheating once I was on meds because I was finally able to see what I was capable of when I was in a supportive environment, felt good about myself, and earning money. We were able to completely get out of debt, we purchased a home, I was in the best physical health of my life, and I began to write and record music more frequently. \n\nThe best advice I can give is to figure out what works for you! I'm autistic and I have ADHD and it feels like everyone tries to push computer science on me as if it would be something that I would automatically be good at. I took a programming class in high school and I think other than Spanish, it was my worst-performing class. I briefly worked in a technology role in the restaurant industry and interviewed outside of the company for a tech sales role and wasn't hired, and it probably was for the best. For some people, computer science is a great fit for autistic people and people with ADHD. Only you know what works best for you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're unable to even recognize what works best for you and feel completely lost, I would suggest that based off what you described, seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist might be beneficial."

    "comment": "At least you‚Äôre not 38 which is when i was diagnosed. Get the help you need. Be kind to yourself. I had a similar experience and floundered through school for 7+ years. 3-4 majors and 3-4 universities before by dumb luck I found something that suited my interests and was achievable with my (unknown at the time) disability. The field happens to have a decent job market. However the career requires a lot of technical writing, and has poorly defined deadlines which don‚Äôt conform to my adhd. I‚Äôve had performance issues at every job I‚Äôve had and switched employers/jobs almost as much as I switched universities. I‚Äôm getting treatment, therapy, and medication. And I‚Äôm looking for a new job ;). I don‚Äôt think my symptoms are as severe as a lot of folks, but the anxiety, depression, and trauma of that cycle is real. I hate it. \n\nI would take a break from school and do a deep dive into your strengths and weaknesses if you can. College is expensive and not necessarily a good return on investment. I did this, worked a job that wasn‚Äôt bad for my adhd, but wasn‚Äôt an area I wanted to make a career out of. \n\nUpon reflection one of my biggest regrets wasn‚Äôt dropping classes or taking classes that didn‚Äôt benefit me, it was the extra 10s of thousands of debt I incurred while spinning my wheels trying to figure out college.\n\n Research jobs that have tasks that maximize your strengths. I like task based work that‚Äôs done at the end of the day or Maybe week. I hate writing, and have always struggled with it (going back to grade school). Longer, Drawn out deadlines just mean I‚Äôll put it off until it‚Äôs near. Which causes me stress and anxiety and requires that I hyper focus to push a project out. In my current job I‚Äôm expected to work and stay on task independently, but usually end up not meeting clients‚Äô expected timeframes, and rushing once they start complaining. I do well with more supervision and even micro-management within reason. \n\nIf I had to do it over, I would have chosen something different. I also struggle with planning anything that isn‚Äôt immediate. I don‚Äôt even plan dinner. Nor vacation or weekend plans a lot of the time. Cooking is immensely frustrating; by the time the food is ready I‚Äôd have rather eaten a peanut butter sandwich, which tastes better, is immediate and has virtually no clean up (not healthy though).\n\nYou might find a trade or skill that doesn‚Äôt require college degree. And you might find a job that suits you, but requires a degree program that doesn‚Äôt. Ask a lot of questions both of your professors and people that actually do the job to gain as much perspective as you can. Keep in mind some college professors have mostly worked in academia and don‚Äôt have a great grasp on the ‚Äòreal world‚Äô applications of their area of expertise. For a while in college I thought I would go into advanced degrees and academia because that was my only exposure to the subjects I was studying. See if you can do a ride along for a day with a working professional."

I had it for the first time with around 20 or smth, then with 24 and a sudden epiphany on why I don't just change my life and then the next day I had already forgotten about it, kind of and went into the same patterns and attitude.\n\nAnd here I am again with 27 and my brother being 35 (iirc). And let me tell you; we have no (real) job, are still poor, have no real goals, ambitions and finally figured out ADHD is prolly the culprit and that I was actually diagnosed with 10. It's awful. I always wonder and wondered why my life passed me by so quicky as if one year is actually just 4 months or smth, but yes, I guess it is indeed the time blindness doing this. And I hate it.\n\nI know people say life goes by faster due to lack of new experience the older we get, but it already started doing by extremely fast rather early on. No friends to go out with, no stuff to explore and experience, just sitting at home in front of the PC and not even working on learning new languages, translating or doing anything anymore really. And the pandemic just made it worse, ugh. Meds, therapy and courses/connection are my only hope atm.\n\nSo to answer the question if someone can relate; I do. I really, really do. And I'm there with you in the pain and hope we all will find comfort and answers in the future. It's exhausting to go on like this and I wish I could say more and more positive stuff.

However, getting **okay** with that is a skill you can develop.\n\n> I just never feel calm and safe\n\nYeah, that's life in your 20's. Like, people glorify it as a period of youthful adulthood, but it's this slog of uncertainty and unreasonable expectations.\n\nADHD amplifies this, and you could feel this way somewhat even if you had completed college and had a nice job that pays well. I know from personal experience. On the other side of uncertainty is a feeling of safety, but you need to build it yourself :-( .\n\n> How could I have goals?\n\nYou wanted to go to school at one point, but when you stopped wanting it it stopped happening. That's how ADHD works. If you want it, you feel like obtaining it is worth a world of effort, but if you don't want it, a world of effort won't make you work toward it. This is why ADHD-friendly project planning is so difficult and yet so important. One thing that can help is an accountability buddy. Someone who will hold your feet to the fire and get on your case if you're wavering. But I digress.\n\nTherapy and medication might help you to focus your thoughts better, and project planning can help you develop goals. There's an all-or-nothing sentiment that comes with ADHD that makes life goals harder to develop (see my first point). If you can, going back to school could be a fixed goal for a time, but at a certain point you'll need to develop goals on your own.\n\nMy philosophy on creating goals is pretty off-topic so I'll put it in a response to this post."

You‚Äôre here to radically love yourself as you are despite what the world around you may want you to feel or believe. Forge your own path."

    "comment": "I'm 31 and I felt like this all through my 20s. It took me 7 years just to get my associate's degree in general studies, all the while working jobs that paid the bills but were nothing I wanted to do. Finally, right around when I turned 29, I decided to make some big life changes and I started therapy (primarily to deal with my marital separation, but I had needed to deal with my depression & anxiety long before that), I moved back in with my parents, and just took some time to let myself heal for awhile and not push myself to do anything but survive, especially since the pandemic started right after that.\n\nFinally, about a year ago at age 30, and after 10-15 years of trying to figure out what I needed to \"do\" with my life, I actually figured out what path I wanted to take, and this whole past year I have systematically taken concrete steps to achieve my goals. Five months ago, I landed a job that I actually love and look forward to going to every single day. Yesterday, I started my first semester back in school in 6 years. In two days, I have a doctor's appointment to talk about finally getting assessed for ADHD, because I am currently undiagnosed. In two years, I should finally have my bachelor's. In about 6 years, hopefully I'll have completed law school and be practicing law somewhere.\n\nMy point is, it will get better. Therapy helps a lot, so I recommend it. Meds probably do too, but I am even doing the \"life on hard mode\" without them (but working on getting that diagnosis so I can get them), and things are still so much better than they were two years ago. But don't buy into the idea that life is over after 25 or 30 or whatever. There is time. Focus on what makes you happy - not like in a big picture sense, but enjoy TV shows, video games, books, food, talking to friends, loving on your pets, whatever brings you joy. That is what makes your life worth living anyway, not how successful you are. But by enjoying these small things, the bigger picture will reveal itself eventually.\n\nEdited to add: I saw that you currently have Covid. When I had it a year ago I was HORRIBLY depressed and felt so similarly. It was literally in the weeks after that that I started taking some huge steps. Once you recover, you will feel much better, I'm certain."

The ‚Äúidea‚Äù of where you believe you should be in life  right now (whether that be already married, employed with a good salary, living on your own and independent etc‚Ä¶ ) - DROP IT. \n\nThis ‚Äúideal‚Äù is like a moving goal post. Simply put, set goals for yourself (specially tiny ones like ‚Äúdo 10 pushups today‚Äù) as a means to building positive habits. Don‚Äôt overwhelm yourself with huge end goals. Small steps like spending 5 minutes every week on learning something‚Ä¶ if it really interests you you will continue to learn for hours but commit to only 5 minutes! 10 pushups, 1 call you have been meaning to make. \n\n2. Accept that you are different. What makes everyone happy will not apply to you. To others you may seem uninspired or lacking drive but ultimately you may realize that happiness is not about settling for less but in finding what is right for you.\n\nMy current job is not paying me what I have been taught to believe I deserve but it pays the bills and allows me to stay sane. For now try to find that and go from there.\n\n3. I know this is incredibly difficult but you have to find a way to limit your feelings of regret. You are so young still but even if you weren‚Äôt it seems you can only go up from here! Be kind to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would treat your best friend or a younger sibling. \n\n4. Look into some of the books others commented on. It is important to learn some techniques for dealing with your inner critic and other positive habits.\n\nYou will always have doubts. You will always ruminate and regret things you did and didn‚Äôt do. None of that matters anymore, focus on what you can do from here.\n\nWishing you the best."

    "comment": "At 25, I was in the same place.\n\n\"I want to change, I've always wanted to change, but I just don't know how\" could've been my motto from my teens to my mid-20s.\n\nIn my 20s alone, I had already dropped out of college, moved back home, worked retail for a bit, gone back to a different school for a different major, moved across the country, and then spent two years post-graduation making no progress towards a dream job that by 25 I wasn't even sure I wanted any more.\n\nI found a therapist, and basically just used her as a sounding board, someone to bounce ideas off of.\n\nI didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, what I was passionate about. So I made a list of every job I thought I could possibly stand. I thought about the specific parts of previous jobs I had enjoyed doing, and the things I hated. Eventually I settled on IT.\n\nIt took months to find a job, but my therapist helped keep me accountable and on track.\n\nThen when the pandemic started, I lost my job and fell back into old patterns. I found a new therapist, who helped me work on coping mechanisms, deal with anxiety, build my own structure. And when I asked about ADHD, she referred me to get diagnosed.\n\nIn the year since I've been diagnosed and started medicine (Strattera), I found a new job (still in IT) that pays nearly twice as much as I was making before. I've figured out a diet and cooking routines that work for me, and have lost 25 pounds and counting as a result. But I think the most important thing is I actually feel like I can set goals and make changes (even if progress isn't always perfect and linear). That wasn't the case, really, up until recently.\n\nI think that's a combination of medication, therapy, strategies I've found from learning about ADHD online, plus understanding (and accepting) how my brain works."

    "comment": "Biggest thing I have to say is 25 is sorta still in development unfortunately.  While my situation is not similar in the slightest, I had a similar mindset when I was around that age. I was on my own with my wife in a different state than where I was born getting her through Law school.  By all rights I was successful for 25.  But then a dread hit me that I haven't actually \"done\" anything.\n\nI spent the past 7-8 years of my life working in the service industry, getting promotion after promotion, worked my way up to running stores as a GM. All  this time I couldn't help thinking \"what am I actually learning.\"  \"My wife is about to be a lawyer, and here I am making sandwiches to pay for rent and food.\"  \"What kind of assistance can I even be in a relationship with that kind of dynamic.\"  \"Shit, she's a lawyer.  If she want's to divorce me she's got all the power, I can't afford an attorney.\"   \n\nIt ended up being a dark time when I came to realize that for all I had \"accomplished\" it really amounted to nothing.  For me, it only got worse.  As I rushed to try and \"prove my worth\" so to speak, I restarted college (I originally started right out of highschool and dropped out because I couldn't bring myself to do the work.  I wanted to, but you know. ADHD will have it's way if it needs to commandeer your body to do it sometimes and I ended up sitting right outside class till it was over each day.) Going a second time didn't end well... actually it was a dumpster fire where anything and everything that could go wrong did.  Residency was submitted two weeks before the due date, not processed by the \"pay your classes\" date and ended up being rejected. costing 4k in out of state tuition for classes I was promised would be reimbursed once residency came back.  The fight for a refund was long and arduous, and right when I finally won.. I gave up.  This was already mid way through the semester, and of course I was certain at the beginning I was getting that refund, so... I didn't do any of my classwork. On top of this, my wife began showing symptoms of an autoimmune disease, and I began trying to care for her, taking on all the housework, getting her to and from appointments, trying to keep her engaged... and unaware of just how bad school was getting.  It ended up an explosion of truth.  I... I really don't know how she forgave me, 4k down the drain, basic ass classes (like the \"New Student Learning Experience\") all failed, and I even left work to focus on school before all this.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow. \n\nWhere I was at then. Does not compare to where I am at now.  25 is so young. Back then I realized that, but didn't feel justified in saying it.  Now some odd years later I have a good job working as an insurance coordinator for a mental health clinic, specifically focused on TMS prior authorizations. I still have to deal with my constant ADHD symptoms (The spreadsheet I use to track patients progress in the authorization process is my greatest ally and my worst enemy T.T) I.. well I want to go back to school to try again (maybe when the pandemic is a bit more under control) and probably do something in the psych field, as working in the clinic has really helped facilitate hyperfixations about my own mental health.  I've been spending a huge majority of my downtime consuming information, and it's been really fun. \n\nWhat I am getting at here is, that time period can be rough.  You are only just coming to grips with the totality of society, and it feels like if you wanted to fit in, you were supposed to start when you were in 1st grade, now that you are 25, you not only missed the boat but you also burned the bridge and now have no chance to be useful, or successful.\n\nSay it with me now, \"That is just not true.\"  The thing you don't realize is you are on the boat, you always have been. Society will not wait for you to mature, it will beat maturity into you (provided your parents don't keep you off the boat.)  \n\nThe boat is about to reach port, and you are seeing the city skyline on your way in.  There is just so much there.  All the roads twisting and turning between huge buildings.  You are more than likely much better off than you think. It's just going to take hindsight to see it. \n\nAlso, I am not sure if you are doing it currently, but try out some form of evidence based psychotherapy.  There are a lot of interesting therapy options with a good bit of research out there, but good ol fashioned CBT is always my recommendation, especially if you haven't seen someone before.  Stay away from the.. uhh.. \"Holistic\" or religious side of therapy, at least for a while.  I have yet to see any study that crystal healing is verifiably effective, and many religious counselors I have seen have next to no actual credentials (some do, but some also have made up doohickey, so just be careful if you prefer to go the religious route)"

Whoa, you're only 25 and you have a clue of what's going on in your brain? You have this community, and (too many) options for help. That's awesome. I used to think I was alone and a terrible human that managed to play a decent human on TV.\n2. This is a weird weird weird time. Between Covid, politics, social media, and 10 other things, if you're not triggered, unsettled, and reassessing your life in some way right now, are you even human? Of course you are. And you're probably one of those people who can read words and take it all in.  Paralyzing. \n3. I've never known \"what I wanted\" and I think people who claim to know what they want are typically wrong. Obviously, YMMV, but what worked for me was to go a little scattershot and just do stuff that looked remotely interesting to me. At your age, it was easier for me to figure out what I didn't want to do vs what I did. (note I ran into other walls later on in life, but life)\n4. Live in the present. You can only control what you do right now, so when you control what you do right now celebrate that little victory.  This is what I'm working on right now.

Take a little time to become the person you want to be, the world will still be there. Don't let the past ruin your future, because ultimately both aren't real, you're only ever here. So make your present enjoyable and the future will follow :) \n\nWith ADHD it's all about baby steps and treating ourselves like children (at least for me). Set your goals very low, but be consistent. Improve 1% a day, you can do it. Don't start running every day and burn out. Don't start meditating for 45 minutes and hate it.

Your best years are ahead - worry not - but consider allowing yourself the grace of finding your way and push forward and continue to build systems and find the right med titration. If you were advising someone who went through recovery during the same period, you'd be kind. You deserve that kindness too. I lost so. much. time. Through age 31, in fact, and only then did I start to slow the waste and it took until 36 to diagnose! I'm 40 now. Had no idea until 4yrs ago I had a mental chemistry issue. You are way better off. You will find your way and already are. One thing I always did to keep moving was taking shots. Doesn't matter at what, necessarily.  Regardless of outcome, keep your aspirations up in whatever ways you can. Look to ppl who inspire you, walk, listen to books, take in nature, exercise. At my lowest points, I reflected on what I knew I could do if I had my shit together and tried to aim my sights at it and improve one thing here and there. Short version, almost all of these were arguably net failures from a capitalist mindset, but there were always - always - several gains. I learned a shit ton of skills to help my get handholds. Ramit Sethi for example had a lot of personal positioning free advice on YT that moved me so far forward. But once I had meds, it all clicked. This note is emotional and rhetorical support, so of course I welcome and likely agree with tactics and strategies others have written. But you are not your early 20s. You are not your khakis, as Mssrs. Durden might say. You are much more than that and your story is only now unfolding! Read it. Write it! Much love!\n\nEDIT: Read your meds posts. Keep titrating. Addy was harsh on my body, I stopped, then yrs of inefficacy later tried again. It helped a ton but more side effects. Tried Atomoxetine. Realllllly effective. Libido was fucking murdered. Loterally shrank the blood vessels in my dick!! Stopped it. Found Vyvanse, getting good effects without much harm and will probably try upping dosage and integrating more diet, sleep and exercise."

You see success over a period of time, and when you have \\_none\\_ of it at the point everything feels hopeless but when you have \\_some\\_ of it things look better and you can grown on top of that platform. Just focus on somehow building the platform even if it's small or rickety, but when you build something (be it getting better at communication, learning a new skill, reading a book) that helps your current situation you'll start feeling better and be able to build some momentum off of that.

This gives you an absolute sense of control over what you are doing.\n\nPlan out your day and FOLLOW IT‚Ä¶nothing better than tackling everything head-on and not forgetting because something else popped into your head (speaking from a person that used to leave multiple projects started and never finished)\n\nTake notes‚Ä¶Anytime something pops into your head at random, write it down and revisit later.\n\nFind your passion‚Ä¶Do what you love and you will hyper-focus your way to success!\n\nBest of luck to you. I do take Adderall 15mg XR in the am and 20mg in the afternoon. This keeps me on track."

I'm still working in my field but its just been bouncing from one job to the next unable to build skills before getting checked out and buried by imposter syndrome. I've been circling the drain while my peers and colleagues have continued on to grow in their fields and it just makes me feel fucking hopeless.  \n\n\nAll signs are pointing to the adhd and comorbid depression being treatment resistant so I just truly feel alone."

The only thing that matters is now, this moment. Make the change, get help and live. Some things that helped me before I got diagnosed and medicated were bullet journaling, thought journaling and stoicism/Buddhism (meditation, philosophy, etc.). The bullet journal helps me plan but also see what I have done. The thought journaling helps with emotions, I feel better when I lay it all out, it‚Äôs not meant for reference just vomiting emotion. Stoicism/ Buddhism has helped with meditation, living in the moment and self accountability and forgiveness. Im still doing these things and they are soooo helpful. Also advocate for yourself."

    "comment": "Wow. I have never resonated so deeply with 100% of someone‚Äôs words like this before. This is literally the first comment I‚Äôve ever made on reddit cause it rocked me that hard. I‚Äôm 28 and feel the exact same way, I feel like my last 10 years or so since high school have been aimless half attempts at making it look like I‚Äôm not a complete fuck up even though I have absolutely no idea what I‚Äôm ever doing. Growing up in elementary school it took me until about 4th grade until I realized the reason the other kids always knew what to do was because they were actually listening to and comprehending what the teachers would say when giving us directions, something that honest to god had not even occurred to me. Definitely a lot of natural shame that you sort of develop and nurture over time for being like this, but the fact that you‚Äôre genuinely invested in trying to figure it out goes to show that it‚Äôs not just some moral failing of yours and is a genuine debilitating mental condition. Almost every week me and my gf sit down and try to figure out ways for me to improve my habits to be more successful and every week I‚Äôm back where I started. I am medicated but it doesn‚Äôt work as well for me as it appears to for a lot of other people. I get very irritated and distant so it‚Äôs sort of a trade off for me. But obviously as you can tell from some of the other responses not only are you not alone and are heard, but some people here are experiencing almost the exact same thing along with trying everything in their power to overcome it, as you are trying to do. I feel constantly hopeless about ever getting to a stage where I feel relatively put together, but 3 years ago I was addicted to pain killers and didn‚Äôt have a job stuck in Alaska wasting away, and now I‚Äôm light years ahead of that with a good job and amazing girlfriend in San Diego and we just got another puppy. Key thing there is I was your current age and so many things since have changed for the better, while I feel myself personally has barely changed at all. My advice is to not lose hope that you‚Äôll get where you need to be even though I know how soul crushing and impossible seeming it is. Don‚Äôt start valuing yourself less cause of your lack of direction just because you haven‚Äôt been in a situation that can help you thrive. You‚Äôre always still worth the world as long as you don‚Äôt give up on yourself!"

Like you were able to articulate your problem in this post. So get a notebook. When I write in my notebook my thoughts are forced to slow down to the pace of my hand. Sometimes my mind goes ahead, but then I can slow it down again, re read what I wrote and continue on. It has been the biggest improvement to my life since I found out I have adhd. Obviously getting yourself to actually write is a challenge. But when I do it helps so much for organise my thoughts, goals and perspectives. Obviously again, not all strategies work the same for everyone. Hope this helps even a little though."

You can either make it in this world by trying something new that scares you every single day and adopting a brand new mindset - one which you chase life rather than waiting for life to find you - or you can keep on keeping on as you are now, in the same place you are now, feeling as you do now.. and the only person in this world that will feel sorry for you is yourself."

    "comment": "How could you know what you want if you never *found yourself lost?* Many people are, in my view, dispassionately institutionalized. They work to live, to be happy. Whichever. That is fine. Though, as having ADHD, there isn't a casual choice through life, because frankly, we're misfits. We're not punctual, we don't think in evenly split moments of time, days, weeks, or months. There are thoughts and they leapfrog into one another.\n\nIn modern society, we're broken records. Like a lo-fi record with too much noise, or too short an exhaust bumbling about. But see, that is where the magic happens. That is where knowledge ends and creativity starts. No, not due to ADHD necessarily, but due to the circumstances requiring unusual adaptations to cope. That is where you start realizing you're different and common sense doesn't apply.\n\nI used to break over and over thinking I would never fit in. I did not indeed. I realized however, when you break, our minds rewire in new ways if you learn to allow it to detour. It cannot help *but* find new ways to adapt. When you fail in life sufficiently, there is one gift bestowed, and that is resilience. Passion is not ruled by reason or measurement but an adamant desire to express. Sometimes you just have to ram headfirst through the wall until either the wall breaks or your skull breaks. Because you know you will get through one way or another.\n\nIf society does not let you in, force yourself in. Find your own books, make your own education, create your own luck. The means justify the end. If someone gives you crap about morals, point to the burning wreck behind you and ask them again. Everyone wants to do good, yet few want to take responsibility for themselves to do what is required to succeed that is unconventional. Life **is** unconventional."

    "comment": "Obviously you aren't alone on feeling like this. I'm recently diagnosed but have struggled with symptoms since childhood. ADHD makes a lot of little things hard. Keep pushing forward and don't give up. I think of it like people end up taking the more scenic route in life rather than the direct path, even if we don't mean to sometimes, but that can often teach us or expose us to many different things along the way and help make us more well rounded. \n\nI got diagnosed a few months ago, but here are a few tips that have helped me. Find a good team of professionals you trust. A good psychiatrist can help you find your ideal medication, although it might take several tries for some people. Therapy (from a psychologist, counselor, social worker, or other mental health professional) can also help so much. So far, mine has helped teach me skills such as time management, stress management, mindfulness, setting SMART goals, reducing procrastination, reducing distractions, etc. Wearing a watch, using Google Calendar, and setting timers on my phone have also helped me a lot. You can also learn from other resources too, such as YouTube, books, and articles online. \n\nFor your education, I recommend sticking as close to your original passion as you can but adjust to something similar depending on your strengths and/or weaknesses if needed. I ended up with several degrees because I'm academically gifted overall but faced certain struggles that kept me from reaching the goals I had in mind for myself. Instead of trying something similar when I didn't succeed as intended, I tried something totally different but wasn't satisfied years later. Then I went back to school again for something closer to what I originally wanted but was better suited for. \n\nYou can try this [career quiz/interest profile](https://www.mynextmove.org/explore/ip) from the US Department of Labor to make sure you're on the right track to a career that you'll love based on your career interests and amount of time and education you'd like to put in. \n\nSince ADHD qualifies as a disability, you can also request ADA accommodations for things like school, work, and certification exams for professional associations. Accommodations can be different things to help people be more productive, function better, make things easier for them, etc. It can be things like more time on tests, excused time off from work for doctor appointments/therapy, additional meetings or feedback from managers at work, using noise cancelling headphones or earplugs to reduce distractions, etc."

    "comment": "I'm 30 and just started taking Adderall again for the first time since high school. The last couple of years I started to panic - feeling like I wasted my 20s. Now I don't look at it that way as much - more like I got to spend a decade figuring out who I am as an adult, what I like, and how to handle jobs/relationships/etc. Of course there's a couple of things I wish I would have done differently. \n\nThe big one right now is that I wish I would have worked on my credit more by paying school loans on time and keeping a credit card open. Now I'm having to rebuild my credit which takes time. But it's also not the worst thing in the world - the thought of even looking at my credit used to make me want to shove my head in the sand - but now it's not as difficult to start building back up as I thought it would be. \n\nI think when we're younger we have this mentality that we need to have everything done by a certain time in order to be successful in life. But in reality you can look at someone who has finished school, landed the perfect job, got married, had kids, etc, and for all we know they could hate their lives. Many people end up wishing they'd taken the time to just enjoy themselves when they were younger.\n\nMaybe try and change your perspective on your life. It might help to think \"I'm glad I got to spend part of my life just enjoying it. Now I want to do this ____\" And then pick one goal that interests you to work towards and figure out how you can make that a priority. Consider hiring a coach, looking into meds, asking parents or friends to help keep you accountable - anything that might help. I had to move back in with my parents multiple times in my 20s and looking back I wish I had asked my parents to make me pay rent and just keep that money saved up for me when I wanted to move out or go back to school. \n\nAnyway, know that you are absolutely not alone in feeling this way - especially among those of us with ADHD. It's difficult for us to choose a path when our brains switch interests so fast."

But time passes so fast, and the longer you stay trapped in that thought process the more time you'll waste. You can't berate yourself back in time. Theres no changing it. Meanwhile, your life moves on. I decided I didn't want to have the chapter that followed to be the chapter of regret. I'm certainly not perfect and I absolutely have my down days, but I try to just see my 20s as part of my journey. They weren't great, but I did exist, and I did learn some things along the way.  Write it into your story. Look towards the future and set some very small, achievable goals. Take it a day at a time. You only exist in the present, and before you know it another 5 years will have gone past. Do you want to have wasted those 5 years regretting the 5 years that came before it? Soon, the years you're focusing on now with so much regret will be just a period in your past. Don't let it hold you prisoner.\n\nAlso, try not to compare yourself to others. I'm currently living with my parents and saving to buy a house. I probably won't manage it until my mid-thirties. Many of my friends bought in their early 20s, and I spent so much of my time feeling like a failure. I didn't have a good enough job, or enough money, or a partner, or whatever. I compared myself too much to other people. But my life is just on a different track. Its on its own schedule. Try to trust in the journey if you can trust me, I know it's hard. But life isn't a series of milestones someone else has set out. Im choosing choosing save for a house because I'm in a position to, and it's right for me now. That's all. Not because it is is is expected of me. Even if you meet none of the expectations of modern life, what matters is you are happy. Focus on happiness and it can go wrong. It'll be hard, but never wrong."

I managed to finish my degree (with a 'gap' year and an extra semester), but have forgotten approximately everything I learned somehow, and I don't even work in my field anymore.\n\nBut I am working on it. My advice is to start very, very small with your goals. You don't have to do everything at once.\n\nStart with small goals, and start with the most vital to your basic functioning. You can't start with the bigger goals until your mental health is under control.\n\nFor me, the goal order goes like this (with my personal examples in parentheses):\n\n1. Mental health (basic -- meds, therapy)\n2. Physical health (basic -- hygiene, basic nutrition, sleep)\n3. Basic needs (job/school, housing, financial security, food, etc)\n4. Life Quality goals (hobbies, friendships, leisure activities, art)\n5. Improvement goals (starting to exercise, organization, learning skills, reading more, improving grades, etc)\n6. Big Scary Life Goals (saving for a house, grad school, figuring out what I want for my career, pursuing said career, art and composing goals, weight loss, etc)\n\n(I put Life Quality before improvement because for me, personally, it is very hard to work on scarier goals without a strong base of fulfillment from life.)\n\nI'm still working on 1 through 5, but I had to get 1 nailed down before I could even think about the rest.\n\nIt sounds like you have a ton of anxiety, and you don't know where to start. I would say to start with your basic mental and physical health needs -- those are the foundation of everything else. Then, pick one goal for your basic needs, work it, and continue. \n\nI stalked your profile briefly to see if you had posted about being on medication -- it sounds like stimulants may not be for you, or maybe you need something else to help the anxiety. Get the meds nailed down, and *then* you can start focusing on other goals.\n\nGood luck!"

    "comment": "So couple thoughts here:\n\nFirst off, you‚Äôre only 25. That‚Äôs really young. A lot of people are still living at home at that age, especially in other countries (I assume you are in the US.) You have plenty of time to pick a path in life and do what you want. And you don‚Äôt have to find a passion (in terms of your career.) I work for a state agency, it‚Äôs not particularly interesting, but it‚Äôs a good job with good pay and benefits. I got my degree in a completely unrelated field. \n\nSecond is that nearly everyone experiences this. It‚Äôs not an ADHD thing. You go about you life day by day and then ‚Äúwhat the hell it‚Äôs been 5 years already?!?! I‚Äôve done nothing with my life!‚Äù\n\n>\tYou are young and life is long, and there is time to kill today.\n\n>\tAnd then one day you find ten years have got behind you\n\n>\tNo one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun\n\nThe third, and this can be a comfort or terrifying, is that most people don‚Äôt really do anything noteworthy with their life. People often stress about not doing enough and accomplishing enough, but the average person really has very little impact on the world. If you move out at 27 and get some generic office job and live in a mediocre apartment, nobody cares.  Nobody is going to be disappointed in you, except you."

    "comment": "Totally understand you on this!\n\nTime blindness makes me feel like these past 24+ years have disappeared in the blink of an eye.\nPersonally been medicated for ADHD since 8th grade, but unfortunately it wasn't until this year (Age 25!) that the doctors finally managed to get the dosage/med type correct. Even then, every day I feel stressed out about not accomplishing enough, or about not finishing college yet, or even about forgetting little tasks! Because of being diagnosed & medicated so young, it makes me feel... bad, I guess, that I'm still struggling with getting things done. There's a lot of people who aren't able to receive help until adulthood, so it feels like I should be able to do more.\n\nBut! That being said it's important to remember that everyone grows at their own pace. It's easy to feel pressured due to expectations in society, but no one is exactly the same. You can only measure your grow and accomplishments against your own circumstances! At the end of the day it's important to remain kind and patient with yourself as well. It's hard for us to do well and thrive when our inner voice is beating us down... (although it's okay to have moments where it happens!)\n\nYou still have plenty of time to do the things you want to do. You still have opportunities, chances, and the strength to make little steps towards your future! Go for it!!"

This is how you get out of that funk. \n\n1) Realize you want to make a change. \\*you are here  \n2) Sit down, block out any distractions and write out how your life is now compared how you see your perfect life in 5 years. Visualize it. Detail it out. Ask yourself what does it look like? What does it feel like? Describe it in detail.   \n3) Put this writing somewhere where you will see it everyday and just quickly review it once in the morning and night.   \n4) That's it. \n\nWhat will happen is as you review this daily once in the morning and once at night, you will subconsciously start to gravitate towards your ideal self.. you might have an ideal self of losing 20 pounds with a goal weight of 180 pounds and so you review this everyday once in the morning and once at night.. as you do this you carry this thought with you subconsciously throughout the day and slowly start doing the things you need to do to reach this goal. As you start your day with this new mindset, you will without effort start taking the steps to get closer and closer to your goal(s). This goes for any goals you write down. \n\nIf you find yourself not moving forward with a goal, what you need to do is another writing exercise where you ask the question \"what is holding me back?\", and just free-write. Write out anything that comes up and don't stop until you find the root cause. Often there is a limiting belief or mindset about something that is preventing you from moving forward. Does that belief or mindset serve you today? If not.. change it. Mindset is everything and if you let external stimulus such as other people, TV or social media decide how you should think and feel which is contrary to your goals.. well shit.. yes of course your will be depressed and anxious because you are going against your own wants and desires. \n\nI can go on and on.. but this should be good enough to follow and take action.\n\nGood luck buddy.

Recently moved to my wife's family farm to try build a new life here and having to try keep up with normal people is basically what my life has become. I think she thought having a level of external pressure would magically usher me into blossoming into the man I always wanted to be or whatever but instead im just isolated, have no friends here, live on the in-laws farm and feel the never ending weight and burden of being the odd one out more than ever before... I was 'helped' into an outdoors manual labour job by my MIL and I genuinely struggle to get to sleep, then get up, and I can't maintain the drive or motivation to perform like I'm expected too at all. The anxiety is overwhelming, even with my 70mg vyvanse a day im only capable of small bursts of productive energy followed by slow and drawn out down time to recharge. Honestly no idea what the answers are but I do wish I had just been able to pick a thing and get good at it when I was your age. If your enjoying ur studies, please plan to use it.

It's a problem that many of us feel everyday.\n\nOne thing that I will say seems to work for me, is changing my environment. Get out of the house. Find ways to trick your brain into \"productive mode\". Go to the library, the coffee shop, spend time studying or planning in the classroom after class.\n\nConsider your options regarding getting out of your parents house. It isn't financially feasible for many at your age, but for some, it's a requirement for moving forward.\n\nAs for goal setting. It's unfortunately going to be a hard requirement for clawing your way out of the hole you're feeling trapped in. This DOESN'T mean that you are beholden to any goals you set. You should always be reevaluating your situation, reaffirming that you are still on the correct path. But you HAVE to pick SOMETHING.\n\nMaybe try adopting the limited time perspective that you statistically only have about 55 years left on the planet, and that is FAR from guaranteed. So you need to get moving if you're going to prioritize being happy and accomplished for most of those. We wake up to basically the same routine every day, this tricks our brain into expecting to always wake up to the same opportunities, implying that we have plenty of time to do anything we want. But we don't. We miss out on opportunities EVERY DAY, and one day, we won't wake up. \n\nNo one gets anywhere running in 360 directions at once, and unfortunately, that's the first instinct for many of us.\n\nCheck out a couple books:\n* Driven to Distraction\n* Deep Work\n* Atomic Habits\n\nAlso maybe look into Bullet Journaling, ADHD creators like Jessica @ How to ADHD."

The first half of your title says time blindness caused it, the second half mentions being filled with regret. If time blindness caused it, why the regret? You're looking for a deeper answer that doesn't neglect any factors. It's possible that you were doing the best you could up till now, while also still needing to do better going forward. You have growth to make and barriers to overcome. There's no reason to be hard on 20-25 year old you though at all. That's pretty early to realize the ways in which you want to grow. I just finally started grad school in my 40's, and I don't regret my path in getting here at all. 20 something me finished a psych degree because I liked psychology. 40-something me wants to make a difference, serve my community, and give back. People spending their early 20's figuring themselves out and what matters is well within par for the course. That part seems totally normal even by neurotypical standards to me, 25 is honestly ridiculously young to be feeling like you wasted your potential. So my advice is to forgive yourself for taking this long to figure out that you want to make changes. Now move onto the changes part. \n\nWhat you're talking about is long term procrastination as this hilarious yet all too familiar [Ted talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_urban_inside_the_mind_of_a_master_procrastinator) points out. \n\nThere's a highly recommended book (that I never finished lol) called \"You Mean I'm not Lazy, Crazy, or Stupid?\" as well as looking for other systems and solutions for managing the effect of your symptoms on your life. I use Siri and Alexa heavily, pill reminders, and I just bought post-it notes to start leaving myself notes near things that need to be addressed when I have time. I might start putting helpful wisdoms on some, who knows? I made a separate home screen widget on my phone for \"urgent\" tasks separated from the rest of my reminders. What I'm trying to suggest is that you work on creating systems that work for you that counteract your symptoms. Set a monthly reminder to examine your life's direction if you need. Mostly though, I give myself a break and realize that everyone has struggles, these are just what mine look like. \n\nFinal takeaway though...dude, 25 is way too young to be beating yourself up for not making more of your life. Like waaaaay waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyy too young. Show yourself some of the kindness and empathy that you wouldn't hesitate to show others."

You're not alone in your experiences. \n\nThis world is not an easy place, and surviving in it without losing your kindness or compassion is an accomplishment on its own. I know how ADHD creates a terrible feedback loop between executive disfunction and rumination, and the best advice I have is to find any toehold to disrupt that loop. Try experimenting with incremental next steps that are positive changes rather than getting consumed with where it'll all wind up.\n\nFor me, stable work made a huge difference. At 33, I was still working in a bookstore because I could never get myself to decide what I wanted to do. Sheer financial desperation got me to start applying for things, and through luck and persistence, I managed to land my first career-path job at 35 (and I got it because it related to some of the personal interests that I'd hyperfixated on, that I'd been told over and over were a waste of time--so don't discount anything you spend your energy on). At 38, I got my ADHD diagnosis and started meds, and I realized parts of my job were making me unhappy, so I got a better job. My work isn't related to any of the things I thought I wanted from life when I was younger, but it challenges and rewards me in ways that don't overwhelm me.\n\nI still don't know what I actually want to do with my life, and I'm sad that I lost so much time. But getting some stability made it easier for me to understand that I can't change my entire life all at once and to take a step back from that destructive ADHD feedback loop. The best thing I can do with my energy is identify the next step I can take that will be an improvement."

YOU GOT THIS!"

Many will imply, or straight out accuse you, of being \"immature\" for your age. What I see in their actions, however, is a thinly veiled jealousy that I didn't bog myself down with societal pressure to conform, like they chose to do. \n\nMany people my age secretly wish they had the confidence to be as aloof and carefree as me. The older I get, the more I lean into that freedom,  instead of trying to fight against it."

    "comment": "I stagnated for a year here and there, and I know the pain of looking back and asking how it happened. After it happened a few times, I realized the pattern and started coming up with a few ways to break it. Here's my technique for developing goals and continuing on my \"life path\" as it were.\n\n## Rule 1. Always be learning\n\nIt doesn't matter what. Spent all summer learning about geology? Great! Write it down. The past six weeks you learned enough about the music theory of India? Cool, write it down.\n\nThis way, I'm never turning off that tap of knowledge, meaning it is always flowing and I'm always growing. By writing things down, I have the ability to potentially draw on that knowledge, and developing the **skill of learning.**\n\n## Rule 2. You Don't Get to Choose\n\nI don't get to choose when I want to do something. It's like there's a rat in my brain pulling the levers of motivation, and I just need to obey the rat. When I obey the rat, it's like going downhill and everything is easy. When I want to do something else, it's like going uphill and everything is hard if not impossible.\n\nThe trick is recognizing the rat will **always** change its mind. Sometimes several times a day, and it's possible to recognize that and even maybe wait it out. Knowing you're playing tug-of-war with yourself is instrumental in winning. Otherwise you keep getting knocked on your ass without knowing why.\n\n## Rule 3. Long-Term Goals aren't Dreams\n\nIn my head, I'm super competitive, and I have a hard time convincing myself anything worth doing if I can't somehow be the best at it. Furthermore, the **big thing** I want to do changes pretty regularly. \n\nI took a long time to recognize that those are *dreams* and I can't follow them because they are too ephemeral to capture. Letting go of the pride, that false sense of ambition, all of it is always so difficult.\n\n## Developing Long-Term Goals\n\nGiven the above, long-term goals seem impossible. I have a mental list of things I want(ed) to do that goes on forever. However, there are things I keep returning to, things that align to who I want to be as a person. This may not be a career goal or even a fun goal but something that's important to you. It's got to be important, and not just a dream.\n\nI ask myself, \"this time next year, who are you? How can you be that person?\"\n\n### Get to the Next Step\n\nThere's an image of myself that I know I can't imagine goals for. So, what's just one step toward being that person? That's my goal. If I want to climb mountains, I'll plan to get better at hiking. If I want to write a game I'll plan to get better at game design.\n\nMy desire is to eat the elephant in one bite, the reward of success seems so tangible in my heart. It is not, and I need to be honest that by the time I get to the next step I may not want the end goal anymore.\n\n### Break it Down\n\nWriting a book is just pressing a few buttons hundreds of thousands of times. Every goal can be infinitely divided until I can see the whole picture. That doesn't mean I break everything down, but I have enough detail to where I understand how this goal will start and know roughly the size. I won't lie, this process is **hard work.** If you can, bribe a friend with pizza or something to help you out!\n\n### Plan to Change\n\n*AKA Don't work harder, work different.*\n\nExpect to be wrong a lot, especially starting out. I thought an online course would take you a month, but instead it's taken me... well I never finished it. It didn't hold my attention, and so instead I had to find another way to learn the same content. That pushed out my plans, but I still was moving toward my goals."

When I have issues, I force myself to deal with them straight on and do it alone. As someone who takes pride in independently fixing things, you can imagine how much self-hate I had developed for not being able to just do things no matter what I try or how hard.\n\nI deal with a lot of the same things the OP does. Last year, I was working on a simple form for hours. I reread the questions over and over and my mind just wouldn't process it. Last month, I was working on final projects that took me all week, making extremely slow progress. It's not normal for me to take that long and I felt pressured and overwhelmed at the end of it. I could barely get through finals; my brain just wouldn't absorb any information as much as I tried to study. My undiagnosed ADHD gradually got worse as I kept adding pressure. I felt like my mind was failing me despite the ambitions and capabilities I knew I had.\n\nThe mindset you speak of is what tore me apart for years. I know its your uncle's advice and I respect that it might have helped you. I just want to point out that when you're talking about a disorder, it's not exactly a clear cut situation that you can just force yourself to fix by changing how you think. That kind of advice can make a whole lot of people feel hopeless and incompetent, despite being fully capable of change if they had the right help."

By work well I mean it makes it easier to get started and do tasks as well as getting stuck in unwanted hyper focus. Not 100% but night and day and it lets me focus on the other things that help me regularly. Meditation, excercise, friendships, art, and regular therapy and coaching. \n\n\nI know what you mean about feeling the potential of lost time. I went through a deep grieving period. Some of it was real grief. Some of it was internalized beliefs that were other peoples expections of who I should be. You‚Äôve got to sort that out. A way that it was liberating though was remembering all these past failures and missteps and not having to feel shameful about them anymore because I can‚Äôt be who I thought I should be even by trying as hard as I could. Being able to really sink in and take stock of my strengths and idiosyncrasies in a new way and slowly accepting my sometimes severe limitations. I still have a lingering sense of not ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù. \n\n\nIf you are a reader, listener check out CPTSD by Pete Walker. It‚Äôs not about ADHD. It‚Äôs about healing from painful childhoods and adolescence and becoming emotionally alive again. Most people that didn‚Äôt learn they had adhd seem to have a lot trauma from not knowing and feeling so bad about themselves for so long.\n\n\nBest of luck finding your way.

Instant release is superior in this way since it should be mostly cleared by bed time.\n\nIf you're feeling like you want to try medication again, go with 5mg and instant release."

Just as you've done here, in your main post -- I'd take what I was feeling and write about it while I was feeling it, and then read what I'd written in therapy. Recalling exactly what to talk about is really difficult when you're on the spot and the clock's ticking. If you want to make the most of your time, it's helpful to organize your thoughts beforehand -- ideally actively throughout the week as they come to you. A little clarity goes a long way, but you've gotta (or at least *I've* gotta) grab it when it's there and document it, or it's easy to forget.\n\nI moved out of my parents' house about a year and a half ago, at 27. That was before I'd been diagnosed, but I was lucky to have friends with more focus who could help me, and a future roommate who I could divide tasks with and we could get on each-others' asses about sending that email or finding some options or whatever.\n\nAfter my diagnosis and start on proper treatment last year, it's been a fuckin game changer. I could've gotten out of that house years ago if I was *this* in control of myself. But I wasn't, and it wasn't anybody's fault. I was doing my best. I just didn't know how much better I could do, couldn't get a handle on *what* was holding me back.\n\nIt sounds like you're doing the right stuff. Just stick with it, give yourself time, and make the most of the options you've got. It feels awful right now, but you're on your way. Sometimes growth is slow and hard to appreciate, but it's always painful, and that pain is always worth it. You're on the right track, you've fuckin got this."

I felt entirely incompatible with the working world, so I freelanced. I still don't make great money, but I get to work from my little home office and wear pajamas or sweats every day, and it works for me. \n\nI felt incompatible with romantic relationships, so I just focused on my mental health and getting my work life moving. Last year, at 28, I had my first serious relationship since fuckin high school. It didn't work out (pre-ADHD diagnosis, I had too much going on and felt like a bad partner), but now I'm actually *open* to it, instead of just shutting out options and feeling destined to be alone. I'm *comfortable* alone, I actually enjoy my own company now, but I don't feel stuck there.\n\nYou seem like you can organize your thoughts pretty well when you're focused on it. Just keep doing that, keep giving some focus to these things. You'll find where you fit and what you're comfortable with. It'll take more effort than a lot of your peers have to put in, but *you can do it.* I know you can, because I did, and I'm nothing special.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you need an outlet or wanna bounce shit off someone.

Set realistic goals (behavioral therapy can help a lot with this if you have a good psychologist/psychiatrist!!)

Being honest with her was key, and I tried stuff she suggested even if it didn't work.**\n\n\n\nI went for help with anxiety, depression, and eating disorder-related issues, also suspecting ADHD.\n\n\n\nMy therapist asked me to set some therapy goals. I had no idea where to start, either. We made them vague: take more calculated risks, hate myself less, have a better relationship with food. Then, I mostly vented during sessions. With her guided questions, we pinpointed things that were preventing me from achieving those goals.\n\n\n\nFor example, I didn't feel comfortable taking risks because I overthink everything and ended up doing nothing as a result, stagnating, and regretting it. We talked through things in my past that have made me scared of taking even small risks, and worked on self-talk techniques to confront those negative inner thoughts with reason and logic. \n\n\n\nShe gives me lots of options to work through stuff. Free writing/stream of consciousness really helped us parse through the constant ADHD brain fuzz to target different issues when I couldn't make sense of them. If she suggests something that doesn't work, I tell her that honestly and we try something else. Ex, she suggested making a very specific time management schedule and my brain did not vibe with that at all. I tried it, told her I hated it, and we shelved it. By figuring out *why* it didn't work for me, I managed to work out a time management technique that DOES work.\n\n\n\nA few suggestions for therapy:\n\n- **be honest.** They're not going to judge you. Open up to them. It's hard but they're equipped to help.\n- **take their advice sometimes.** Therapy won't be effective if you shoot down all their coping skills without trying them. Even if you think something won't work for you, try it. Just once. Then tell the therapist about your experience and work from there.\n- **give it a little time.** Change doesn't happen over night. It's about progress, and sometimes it's hard to see progress while it's happening.\n- **fire your therapist.** Aka, find a new one. If you really don't vibe with this one, there are thousands of other great therapists out there. Find the right fit for you."

So it is an oxymoron \nto tell them to not think about it.\n\nI was also diagnosed in 25, OP. So here's my take: take an incremental approach to whatever plan you have now. try to live a minimalist life and do some handicraft. Your anxiety will easily drag you into materialism; and the later, according to research, helps your mental health and career skill immensely.\n\nDO NOT set yourself up an ordinary person's  standard career goal: ESPECIALLY AVOID watching youtube gurus that talked about how they made it in their late 20's and early 30's. Those are bullshit, self-promoting and meant to give you anxiety so you can buy their online courses. Find real life socialisation and therapists. Reduce social media usage to half an hour if possible. Studies have shown the later will drastically reduce your attention span in the long term and you cannot afford to since you have ADHD.\n\nand lastly, try to pursuade yourself that you didn't waste your time. The world has become too volatile for anyone to predict the future with certainty, not to mention their own life. You are not alone, and don't think others are better planned than you do. They are not."

A neurotypical person would be better able to assess what's doable, then follow through and do it.\n\nMetaphorically speaking, most people select two or three managably-sized portions of various foods from the buffet, carry them back to their seat, then methodically finish them, and go back for seconds if they have room. We eagerly pile -everything- that looks good onto our plates, until the heap is too high to see over and too precarious to balance, then trip on the way back to the table, spill everything, and end up getting nothing to eat at all...and yet we think the problem is that we just should have focused on eating faster!"

I've been on adderall since 2014, took a couple of months to acclimate, but once It happened all the side affects disappeared, unless I made any changes to my doses.  I have no problem falling asleep, and my appetite is back to normal.  I wouldn't give up so easily on it.  Plus I believe any medicine to treat ADHD is going to have similar side effects in the first few weeks."

    "comment": "So I'm not an expert but from what I've experienced and read online, your metabolism effects them GREATLY.  For me, I was given Adderall XR.  I would take it at 5:30am, go back to sleep and get up around 7 am as it was starting to work.  Still wired by 9 or 10pm.  My roommate would take Adderall XR and her body would burn through it so fast it was like instant release.\n\nI think most doctors start people on XR because it's 1 pill in the morning and it's not as easy to abuse.  \n\nI told my doctor and she switched me to Vyvanse which is also \"extended release\", but a totally different mechanism of absorption.  It has to be processed in the liver to become active, unlike Adderall XR which is 50% instant release beads, and 50% polymer coated beads that release after the coating is digested.\n\nUnfortunately Vyvanse didn't work for me, so I talked to my doctor and she prescribed two instant release pills per day, which I start tomorrow."

So what's keeping you awake can be NOT having the medication in your system - but again, it's different for everyone).\n\n7. **What you eat/drink can make a HUGE difference in how well the medication works or the side effects you have.** (Esp. true for IR meds. i.e. Vitamin C blocks your body from absorbing the medication, so taking a multivitamin, drinking orange juice, or eating bell peppers... *1 hour Before or After taking your meds* can make the meds not as effective. In the opposite way, NOT having enough protein can make ir meds not last as long, and can cause increased side effects like irritability). \n\n8. **Don't rely on the physical side effects/feelings to tell you if the medication is working or not** (ask yourself questions like, \"Did I get more done today?\" \"Was it easier to focus on *xyz specific thing* ?\" Even ask someone you trust if they've noticed a difference)"

When we're presented with a framework for managing ADHD, at some point we're going to use that thinking skill to point out that all management techniques are \"just do the thing\", and when \"just do the thing\" is demonised, then we can become so good at justifying to ourselves why we shouldn't follow the management techniques etc."

Acids make things worse, because at least for amphetamine, they cause more of it to be in a water-soluble form and water-solubles *suck* for absorption. The more basic environment you can put them in, the better - it makes them more fat-soluble. Adding onto that fat-solubility, you need fats for them to dissolve into.\n\nBasically: eat breakfast before taking your meds, and not just a bowl of cereal. Eggs, bacon, sausage, whatever, just as long as it's *substantial*. And you don't accompany it with juice or soda (acid!).\n\nBesides, I've found it helps with the side-effect of reduced appetite. Not directly, just so that I don't start feeling like I'm starving when my meds wear off because I've not eaten anything of any particular value all day.

    "comment": "Addiction and substance misuse and abuse of stimulants are far from an inevitability, especially with your self-awareness and caution.  It's not like you're treating chronic pain with an opioid. \n\nWhile certain stimulants and opioids clearly have abuse potential, equating that potential is inaccurate and has led to shortages of needed medications for people with ADHD.  They operate on different areas of the brain, and while both have been widely prescribed for a few decades, the opioids are the ones that spawned an epidemic.  \n\nTrust yourself, and don't miss out on an opportunity to have a better life.  I've taken Adderall, or some form of it, for close to twenty years, and I've NEVER felt the need or had the inclination to take more than prescribed, nor has my dosage crept up in that time.  Think about the medication as opening a window to clarity where you can acquire some of the life skills that have eluded you until now.  Maybe you'll need medication long term, but maybe not.\n\nGood luck.  I hope this all works out for you."

Take it one step and one day at a time. Enjoy it while it works, and if it stops working, then you deal with it. \n\nAs for addiction, a lot of adhd meds can cause addiction. It‚Äôs why they‚Äôre so hard to get for some people but if you take them as prescribed by the highly trained and educated professional then you limit the possible problems as much as possible. \n\nEverything has side effects; it‚Äôs just a question of whether the benefits outweigh the cons."

    "comment": "I was an undiagnosed ADHD kid ‚Ä¶ at 30 I went to college and started taking 1 pill daily of Ma Huang - a Chinese ‚Äòherbal‚Äô supplement found at GNC recommended dose was like 4X a day. Graduated in 2000. Ma Huang was removed from market in 2002. FDA determined it caused heart problems and even death by those abusing it. \nAt 60, I decided to try ADHD meds - my daughter had been on them for 10+ years and was a successful accountant, and my grandson‚Äôs behavior and grades improved dramatically when he was put on it at 13.  \nI am almost finished with a book I have been trying to write since I was in my 20‚Äôs. I could finally maintain FOCUS again. \nI have tried several of the meds available, I do not like Adderall IR - love the ER but as most of you know ‚Äúall generics are absolutely NOT equal.‚Äù \nI have had Graves disease since I was 30, so I have dealt with generic versions before and it is extremely irritating the way insurance is PUSHING certain generics as if they are getting paid to do it. None of my preferred meds are approved on my BCBSTX insurance, which is total BS. \nI am now at the point where NO pharmacy in my area carries my preferred ADHD generic - Actavis. I read it was bought or merged with Teva/Mallinckrodt. I am getting offered NEW generics which seem like they are being made in someone‚Äôs basement - inconsistent and low quality. \nI just tried ‚Äògeneric‚Äô Mydayis and I hate the initial IR - it has a very intense teeth clenching IR for first several hours. *I am here looking at REVIEWS for alternatives to try - like Dexedrine. I have only taken 5mg - 10mg highest dose. Is Dexedrine only IR? Does it have the same IR effects as generic adderall? I know I prefer the Amphet/Dextro ER treatment per my experiences and research - but Dexedrine sounds very promising in a world where new pharms are experimenting with our generics and the cost of brand names are astronomically and ridiculously high."

    "comment": "I felt great then awful, on my first ADHD med : Vyvance. \n\nI read what it said about addictions too. I felt dirty, like a drug addict already. \n\nI did not want to be dependant, yet it felt so nice and I even smiled at myself in the mirror. Then I had a breakdown and a meltdown and negative things happened. I felt relieved to cry. It justified not being on them when what I did contributed to the cat being killed. So not my own ordinary self but someone who focused way too much on the wrong things at the wrong time. Fast forward I tried again and after a full month I felt I had more control. Then heart flutters came on the second bottle. The second bottle felt it was a bit too strong with dry mouth really annoying me and somehow sucking on my own tongue. This is ü§™ crazy. I can't stop this oral stim when off them now. It's driving me bonkers. I'm wondering if Vyvance will ruin my teeth due to dry mouth. \n\nAfter sticking to a full week, of Vyvance with protein meal first, and lots of water, I was sitting for two hours in a car, I developed oedema (fluid building up) in both hands, my stomach swelled, also, both legs and ankles and one of my legs had a warm area (maybe a clot/blockage of some sort), after feeling extremely overheated I started to cough. I stopped the vyvance again. \n\nThe next time I took it, I have lower back pain, very bad pain. I can walk but not sit. Cant help but wonder if its all from Vyvance? I like being focused, but the dry mouth is awful and my Doctor put me straight on 30mg of it and when I said Im trying only 15mg first up and see how I go, she said see you in five months. She seemed annoyed i was being cautious. I did my written assesssment on the day at home and saw her online and she diagnosed me in 20minutes with no report for my doctor referrring me or myself. Id love two hours with her. I said I had insomnia and yet she still prescribed something I cant take unless I take it before 12noon. I usually go to bed at 7am and wake in the arvo. It really isnt what I need as most days I have to skip it as I wake later than 12noon. Id never develop a proper sleep wake circadian cycle if I took it, so Im taking melatonin after this horrible sleep cylce being like this crippling my life as she prescribed it to sleep but with late arvo dose of vyvance and heart flutters and dry mouth to go to bed with, Im over it and just working on my sleep first. I feel its a much better plan to get a better circadian rythym than to make it worse. I dont know the Doctor was listening. I also said I had been diagnosed with Bipolar and she brushed it off. I got the med notes and it said advise your doctor if you have bipolar as it can cause mania. Well i havent seen that I dont think, but social anxiety improved as did panic attacks and depression. I need something that I can take for half a day though, it wore off pretty quick I felt. Cannot believe the difference from one dose to the next though. Are other meds the same where it feels like the active ingredients were left out or you get a buzz but you dont get anything done? Cant feel anything then its meant to be working. Haha you can only hope. ."

I‚Äôm 31 and started on Ritalin 3 months ago and holy, life changing is all I can say. \n\nI hear what OP is saying, because I have a history of alcohol abuse, but once I got sober and diagnosed and treated, I finally found the solution to my life struggles: an active/honest connection with my psych and therapist, good sleep, and medication management. Not only that, but I can now workout before or after work, I can complete tasks, and be more in living than I am ruminating in my mind. \n\nThis all falls under the umbrella of treatment, and I used to over think and analyze EVERYTHING like OP, until I realized I just need some help balancing the chemicals in my brain and trusting people that have put the work/hours in to become medical professionals that help people."

Ok, then you know its mechanism works - it may just be a question of finding a formulation that minimizes side effects. If the side effects are unavoidable, can you pinpoint which neurotransmitter is being impacted? Is there another med you can add that might smooth out the roller coaster?¬†\n\nI also recommend tracking how long you were on the meds for and seeing if you hit the target titration period. Strattera, for instance, can take up to four weeks to even out.\n\nLastly, I recommend looking into non-stimulants like Guanfacine and clonidine and see if they address any of the ancillary symptoms. Guanfacine can touch emotional regulation in a way that other meds can‚Äôt.¬†\n\nOk one more thing: diet and lifestyle impacts a lot.

It took a couple years, but working with my doctor I found that taking IR is the answer, because I can control what I'm taking each day. If I'm sleep deprived, I'll skip my last dose. If I'm not working, I might take 1/2 in the morning instead of a full. On the weekends I cut back a little to help with tolerance. It's perfect, and maybe not for everyone but it's been life changing for me. \n\nI also tried Strattera and hated it. And it made me so physically sick to my stomach and headaches. \n\nAnother recommendation - have you tried behavioral therapy? This can be a great addition, because many of us likely missed learning how to organize and put systems in place ironically because we weren't organized or had systems in place when others were learning these things.

They won‚Äôt go away overnight but they may transform as medication supports other aspects of your life like getting a routine down, feeling more in control and competent, making lifestyle changes, etc.\n\nI spent about ten years on antidepressants before starting adhd meds and one thing I noticed after starting adhd meds was that initially, there were intense waves of medication-related down mood - like s____ ideation down! - and over time they lessened and shortened. It felt like I leveled up every four months. This is Strattera - I‚Äôm sure it looks different on amphetamines.¬†\n\nMy depression, which used to be a constant companion, is now at the point where I know if I‚Äôm feeling it, it‚Äôs because of a lifestyle imbalance or something I ate. Im three years into treatment and starting to see breaks in the cloud cover - moments where i think to myself, ‚ÄúOmg, I could accomplish this thing in my life and I‚Äôm excited about it‚Äù vs ‚ÄúWe got through another day‚Äù - thriving vs surviving.\n\nWith that said, i also do weekly CIMBS therapy, which has been immensely transformative in conjunction w everything else. Dietary changes were major as well since adhd often comes with histamine intolerance, low iron, etc.\n\nAll to say, it may take time to reap the full benefits of being medicated bc it‚Äôs just one piece of the puzzle.\n\nI got a good piece of advice from one of my doctors when I was titrating up and feeling flat and depressed: give yourself time to adjust to the new normal of being medicated."

Meds don't work for everybody and it is no way diagnostic of your ADHD. My psych says ADHD is a clinical diagnosis, your response to meds is not diagnostic. There are plenty, plenty of people who meds do not work for and if I had a dollar for everyone who asked if \"maybe I don't have ADHD\" because I struggled with med side effects then I would be rich. I met and commiserated with another guy who has ADHD and I shared my frustrations and he said \"I'm glad meds work for those people but f\\*ck em if they say that. If anything, your ADHD may be worse/harder to control than theirs\". Sorry, comments like these just strike a nerve. It's hard enough to accept this diagnosis as an adult, and trust me, I struggled with these thoughts and even sought out 3-4 different medical opinions, but don't fall into this misunderstanding of how it is diagnosed or ruled out."

Use the time you're feeling better on medication to build good habits.\n\nI kind of naturally did this when I started my optimal dose. I feel like a completely different person now and it feels so natural. I definitely still have procrastination/time management issues, but when I **do** make it to class, I can actually pay attention. I can take notes. I can *choose* to do my homework. I can read my book and study. I can fully understand the courses that I was told would be \"too difficult\" for me. I wake up early. I go to the gym. I actually eat *more* now and am finally getting to a healthy weight. I can leave the house when I feel the need to go do something like grocery shopping or taking the trash out. \n\nFor the past year and a half I feel like I've been wasting my life away in unproductivity (if that's even a word), so this was more life changing than I thought. It hasn't made me cry, but my brain is definitely happier now."

    "comment": "This is very good advice and I wish I had known the same thing. I always feel a little weary reading posts with people acting like they have their happy ending and the story is over, happily ever after, because I was like that too (for years, even). \n\nI've been on prescribed stimulants for a little over a decade now and while I'm sure it might be controversial to talk about here, I can definitely say I'm addicted. I didn't know I was addicted for the first few years because I got that euphoria simply taking my medication as prescribed and I grew too dependent on that. It does wear off inevitably and you'll think your medication isn't working, but if you compare that state where it \"isn't working\" to taking a day or more off cold turkey, you can see that it's still definitely doing something. Neurotypicals don't usually feel that hypomanic drive to do shit and studying boring subjects or doing chores usually isn't supposed to be easy or fun. My doc, when I raised the issue with him of not really feeling it as much anymore, just told me \"take another\" and also suggested against taking days off (which, in hindsight, could have kept my tolerance low and given me an idea of how I'd function off of them). \n\nNow I'm in a situation where I've really grown used to leaning on that slight euphoria, which I can't really attain because tolerance is through the roof (if I take extras, I just end up running out a week early which sucks). But I'm not in a position to quit and I'm not about to ask to raise my dose even though I have the option because I've dug myself enough of a hole that I'm just going to adjust to that as well. \n\nWhat you do when your brain is flooded with dopamine is reinforced a lot more strongly, so IMO it's important to utilize your medication a little more sparingly than you'd like and only for habituating yourself to the things that are most difficult. I mean, I'd still take it almost everyday, but there's no reason to take it if you have nothing to do or if you're just going to browse Reddit and chill. And taking days off here and there really help with keeping tolerance down and giving you perspective. Also, how hydrated you are and how much sleep you got has a big impact on how effective the medication is. Try to get by on less if you can, try to hold off on re-dosing as long as you can (you can usually get a lot more mileage than you think), and try to practice executing habits/difficult things on days with lower doses (or no doses). All of this is less of an issue with extended release, IMO, because you just dose once or twice a day and it's a lot more subtle... But if you're on immediate release (I was prescribed 5mg of Dex 4x a day), be careful with that."

    "comment": "1. I can‚Äôt emphasize the last sentence of your post enough! Medication is a fantastic treatment, but the best treatment plans are holistic, involving both pharmaceuticals *and* lifestyle changes. Like the golden trio of medication, exercise, and diet change for a type 2 diabetic. Combining ADHD medication, daily exercise, consistent eating habits, and setting up a planner/calendar sticky-note habit has made my life so much easier. My symptoms are still very obvious once my medication wears off, but during the hours my Adderall is active I can get so much done and some of that productivity slips into my evening due to the habits I‚Äôve built. Once you build it, it‚Äôs harder to break a habit than people realize. It‚Äôs been about 3 months of daily checking my pocket planner and now I check it when I get home even if I know I have nothing to do today or tomorrow lol, it‚Äôs build into an automatic reaction to open it up and take a quick look. So I agree so much that the ‚Äúhoneymoon phase‚Äù is the best time to start some of the lifestyle changes that will help the most!\n\n2. Just my experience- I didn‚Äôt get euphoria, nor have I even as I‚Äôve moved up to 40mg per day total of Adderall IR, but I was moved to tears a couple times over the last month (once I hit 30mg+ per day) due to being able to do mundane tasks that normal people find so easy. So for me, that‚Äôs what ‚ÄúThis is how normal people feel all the time?!‚Äù means when I say it. *‚ÄùNon-ADHD people can just remember the customer service lady‚Äôs name at the end of the conversation?‚Äù ‚ÄúNon-ADHD people can just choose to do their homework whenever they realize they need to?‚Äù ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even know people could have less than four active trains of thoughts at one time!!‚Äù* That sort of stuff lol.

Just as there are plenty of people that don't gain enormous amounts of executive function with treatment, there are those that see very substantial gains that persist. Just within my friend group I have a friend with a very manic case of ADHD that is completely insufferable without his stimulants, despite barely being able to notice this fact himself.\n\nI think the most important takeaway people should have is that everyone responds to stimulants differently, you should try all of the frontline meds at different dosages to determine what works best for you, and to realize that even gaining, arbitrarily, 30-40% more daily function is better than nothing. It's completely normal and okay to not feel like you've just taken NZT."

Weight loss is great, but I can hardly eat. I've been having weird sleep related issues. Like, even if I take half a dose in the morning, by the time I get home at 11:00PM, I'll be totally exhausted. I'll stay up for maybe a couple of hours, and fall asleep. By 3:00AM, I'm back up, and wired. It takes hours to get back to sleep. Then the day before yesterday, I got incredibly nauseous halfway through work, I was tired, my head was in a fog, and I started puking uncontrollably. I chalked it up to just not really eating much, and maybe low blood sugar. So, yesterday, after another night of awful sleep, I didn't take it, and just went and got some food. I could barely finish it, and still felt terrible. I thought at that point that it was a lack of sleep, but I still couldn't get back to bed. At that point, I took a Xanax, and got a couple of non-consecutive hours throughout the day. That turned out to be a bad idea, because I got put on the morning shift for today. After giving up on trying to sleep around 5:00, I went about my day. I fell asleep around 10:00 for maybe an hour, and couldn't get back at all. \n\nAll that said, life without the meds is objectively worse. \n\nI know it will all even out, but this sucks. I'm at work, exhausted, and just want to go home, and go to bed. Thankfully, the nausea, and light headedness haven't returned yet."

Since my diagnoses of inattentive type ADHD in december I thought about medication a lot and seen a lot of succes stories on this sub. \n\nI used to be semi-functioning meaning I held down a job and a relationship for a really long period. On the surface nobody would notice my struggle but it was there. Mainly with motivation / starting tasks and finishing bigger task which for a desk job are kind of important  (I mean this semi-jokingly because duh it's important) \n\nNow my feeling today: I took 36 mg of extended release Methylphenidate this morning around 8:30. I had quite a busy morning doing regular weekend tasks. I felt a slight ' high'  feeling in my head but nothing world-changing. \n\nAround 1 pm I had some time to catch up on work because my son  went to bed and now I have been killing a task that has been on my desk for DAYS which I have been working on for days as well. There was progress but in my normal tempo ( lot of distractions; surfing sites, getting coffee / other drinks, getting food, going to the toilet and even some games) . AND BOY WHAT A DIFFERENCE. \n\nI have been working really focused on the taks without even trying to look for distractions. They sources of distractions are here but they just don't interest me that much. I now don't enjoy the distractions because I know they have impact on my work in the coming week / weeks. The distractions will just have to wait until I choose to look at them. \n\nThis does put it in perspective and I hope I can keep at least some of this improvement because I feel so freaking good. It has been a long time ago I have been so proud of myself for something so easy. \n\nTLDR; first day of medication and I feel better than fantastic. This does put it in perspective and thanks OP for reminding me that it doesn't end here. \n\nStray strong people."

There is a lot of truth in what you said but I cannot agree on the \"non-adhd people don't feel like this every single day\".\n\nYes, the first week is something more, the change is dramatic and the memory of how you are without medication is nothing but the sum of your entire existence.\n\nThat is not to say though that the following weeks need to be much different or much less efficient. Most people, myself included experience a drastic decline in the efficiency of the medication at some point, and they attribute it to a number of different things. In the end though they don't really know why the drop occurs or if it should occur. Unless you have an amazing doctor, you won't ever find out either. \n\nWhat I am saying is there is no evidence besides anecdotes to point to the fact that we shouldn't constantly be feeling almost like the first week (superpower discovery euphoria and excitement aside) . My own experience indicates that the same potency is achievable, when you really get to know how the meds work, what they interact with, how sensitive you are to them, how they are metabolised, the exact dose you need to reach that state, etc. \n\nIt is simply way more complicated than most people come to know, and far more than 99% of doctors will have the knowledge to teach you or take the time to deal with. That doesn't mean the optimal effect does not exist past the first week, merely that most people don't know how to reach it. For example, long-term tolerance is not supported by evidence with these meds. Yet most people think they have built tolerance to them.\n\nSteady state concentration, half-lifes, urinary ph, gastric PH, sensitivity to medication, food and drug interactions, time of ingestion and even brand specific differences to fillers - are only some of the factors that might change nearly everyday in your life. All of these will more or less affect how the medication works. These pills don't work in a vacuum.\n\nFor me, through my journey with medication, the more I come to understand all the above factors, the closer I have come to feeling like day 1 again. And on some rare days, I get the exact same feeling I had 2 hours after taking my first ever Vyvanse pill, if only for 30 minutes. It reminds me that it's nothing to do with tolerance or the amount of time I've been medicating for. It's simply a bit more complicated than taking the same amount of medication every single day, and expecting the same results - when so many other things that affect those results constantly change."

The other one made me feel like my blood boiled and I was really mad about a thing (not a small thing but still) for a week. I told the nurse if they invrease the strength on that one, I‚Äôll rip put the window and fly away.\nSo I went back to first one. Did it solve everything or anything for me? It does help to focus on one thing. But ofc I still have symtoms. My knowledge about adhd and my diagnosis have done more than any med could do. I‚Äôm still learning how and what makes me tick. But its like now I got a manual. \n\nSry for bad english, meds should also be ‚Äùout of my system‚Äù at this point."

Whether someone has ADHD, Depression, Anxiety, etc.\n\nIt's good to take breaks from any substance as well.  I call them \"wash out periods\", when I can afford to.  Then re-instate at a lower dosage, as it's more effective after taking a break.  Especially after daily use for a long time.\n\nPersonally I have to find my sweet spot.  Too high of a dose, and I just want to sleep.  Too little and it's a real challenge to focus on anything I really need to get done.  But, it's only an aid, within a multi-spoked approach to gain control over the symptoms.\n\nI find it harder in the Winter to get going.  But, I can tell as soon as I've been slacking on exercise, and eating good meals throughout the day.  When I exercise daily, it's like being a totally different human being.  It does so much good for body/brain/mind.  If I slack off for a week, I become extremely depressed this time of year.\n\nFinding a proper diet can be tricky as well, as everyone is different.  There is no one approach which will work for everyone.  So each individual needs to try different things out, and figure out what works for them.  Best to avoid things that will cause overall inflammation, as part of a nutritional plan.  Exercise in itself helps with inflammation as well."

    "comment": "Yes this 100% correct. I have been on adderall since I was 15 and I‚Äôm 38 now. Over the years as I got older and my brain chemistry changes, the way adderall worked in my system has resulted in massive increases in anxiety and other knock-on issues that effectively make continuing that treatment counterproductive and harmful. At a certain point I began abusing it (taking an extra dose at 5pm to be the Office Superman everyone once in a while), but I told myself that being on adderall is the only way for me to be productive and functional; I also denied that it was even possible to abuse it because it was doctor-prescribed. \nYadda yadda yadda, I just got out of a week long stay in mental hospital after a nervous meltdown that wasn‚Äôt caused by Adderall necessarily but it certainly helped sustain it. I‚Äôm transitioning off adderall to straterra now. I hope it works. \n\nAnother thing about adderall: it‚Äôs a controlled substance, which means you can‚Äôt setup multiple refills, nor can your doctor write you more than one prescription at a time. It‚Äôs always fun when you ask for a new scrip, get no answer from the doctor‚Äôs office, then have to call them and act like a crazy person to goose them into action only to find out that your doctor is on vacation and the back up prescriber has other patients in front of me. It‚Äôs not hard to act crazy because the withdrawal symptoms will MAKE you crazy. \n\nI don‚Äôt know how it works when you‚Äôre diagnosed for the first time these days, but when I was 15, there was no discussion about giving me coping skills to help me handle my symptoms on my own it was literally ‚Äútake this pill and you‚Äôll have no further problems.‚Äù \n\nSo I think if you‚Äôre getting prescribed adderall, it should be for a relatively short period of time so you can get to a point where you can build coping skills, and then transition to a non-stimulant that doesn‚Äôt make ADHD diagnosed people jump through loads of bureaucracy to get ahold of. It becomes a trap that is very difficult to see and break out of. \n\nGood post OP."

I'm 43 and I started the guinea pig process for meds a couple months ago.\n\nI've learned to take the meds if I know I have a big day ahead. If I have nothing to do, I won't take them as they make me feel crappy, tired, and decrease my lack of motivation, since I have no specific tasks that I need to complete. \n\nWorks for me, others are different. I've lived this long without them, (terribly in some instances, including years of self medicating and addiction,) and I am now at a point where I understand the neurological reasons why I do the things I do. It makes it easier to incorporate diet and exercise plus meds, instead of totally being on them 100% of the time. I say this because I was originally one of the people who thought, \"if I just take a pill everyday, I'll be a brand new person.\" I leaned quickly this is not the case.\n\nThe more you learn about the neurological reasons our brains are different, as well as understand the negative/traumatic experiences we can face just because we are wired differently, meds alone aren't going to be a magic pill."

Seeing posts like this, and no follow-ups, can definitely lead people to the wrong conclusions. It builds up this idea that this is what your meds should be doing, and people who are just starting or seeking treatment might find themselves upping their dosage unnecessarily as they seek to have results that they erroneously believe are what they should be feeling. People new to medication should be allowed to celebrate the way they feel, but maybe we need automod to provide context about the first few days/weeks versus long-term expected effects of medication."

    "comment": "This is a complex subject. For me, I am addicted to having a measure of control over my ability to motivate myself to tackle difficult tasks. I use meds for that. Whenever I can, I try to take breaks from them/reduce my dose, so they can affect my psyche more when I take them for something serious. If a very difficult situation or set of tasks comes up, I take my full, daily prescribed dosage to compensate for my disability. So, I rely on my meds, like a crutch. Therefore, when I need a refill of my meds, and it is not forthcoming, I absolutely feel panicked and stressed. I used to think I was addicted to the meds themselves, and worried about it, but I realized I just don't like being without my reliable crutch for the difficult times. For context, been on them 4-5 years now, with a year or two completely off them in between. But I also didn't have a doc who told me not to take time off them. And I I've almost never taken a higher amount than my daily dose, and never has a doctor directed me to do so. I feel for your situation and sorry to hear you were pushed so hard into the meds. For me, I find the euphoric peak of my meds which is 2-3 hours after taking them (Vyvanse in my case) somewhat distracting. I find I am most productive just after that. Hence I sometimes reduce my dosage to avoid the sharp peaks.\n\nIn conclusion meds and our relationship with our reliance on them and the way they affect our psychology and physiology are very complex and difficult to navigate. I think OPs point about euphoria is accurate, however."

Weeks in a row with a lot of work (that require more meds) ended up leaving me absolutely drained and desperate for a med break. Dexedrine is a completely different drug. BP is normal. Don't get tweaked. I can't believe adderall is even used, let alone as the first drug people try, dexedrine/vyvanse are so much nicer on the body (and mind)."

The immediate side effects are obviously the first day, but I'm talking long-term side effects. Strattera made me horrifically nauseous, vysanse made me tense up my body so much i could not have sex without a lot of pain, ritalin makes me clench my jaw so hard i have permanent intense face pain, zoloft gives me tremors, lexapro makes it very very hard to orgasm and all stimulants give me anxiety and raise my heartrate to concerning levels and make me crash horrifically in the evening when they wear off and I just lay in bed the final hours of the day until I can fall asleep. \n\nBut I take them cause it's still much better than the alternative, and it helps me live somewhat of a functional life, get myself to answer my emails and pay my bills, do some exercise, make health appointments, and wash my dishes. \n\nUse the initial period to set out good structures, routines, habits, etc: make those appointments with health professionals you have put off, see an ADHD therapist specializing in managing your life more efficiently, fix your sleep rhythm, and set up an exercise regime.  \n\nThat euphoria is lovely but it goes away : you must not chase it because that will lead you down to dangerous roads.  What is left after a year are the side effects and a somewhat higher base level of functioning. Temper your expectations to reasonable levels."

Now my doctor thinks my 54mg dose is not high after understanding how my body interacts with the drugs.\n\nOn the opposite, we discovered that my body slowly overtime takes in most of the SSRIs, so overtime, I felt a need to take less, as my dose I was taking seemed to have stronger effects for no reason all of a sudden. And I'd end up quitting the medications. Turns out its also why I dont build tolerances to addictive things, my body has a tendancy to throw out most doses of these things and one day my body may throw out more than another. Fascinating stuff.\n\nMy doctor asked if I wanted to switch to Focalin after that but we decided to just stay on my 54mg concerta and to revisit Focalin if it starts to feel too mellow, then if Focalin has the same affects as adderall (I had anxiety and bad dry mouth) we could always up the dose to 72mg concerta since I am genetically going to take that dose the same way someone else may take a 36mg dose.

For example, if you have to write a report just open all the relevant tabs you need and format the paper. The key is to either lower the barrier of entry so you DO actually do it, or just to get everything ready for when you decide to start so there are no distractions.\n\n-Don‚Äôt focus on EVERYTHING. I like to narrow it down to two tasks i need to do that day. Then I get to choose which one! Idk why this works, but it does. After each thing, if you‚Äôre having trouble switching give yourself a 30-minute break. \n\n-Top tier tip: if you need to get up and Simply Cannot, say OUT LOUD ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting up at the count of 5‚Äù and then count down out loud. There is some neuroscience reason this works, but I cannot remember it. \n\n-Finally, and I‚Äôm sorry for this one, but get a planner. Neurotypicals have gentrified the bullet journal, but I‚Äôd HIGHLY recommend doing the original version. Basically, blank pages and you just create a schedule for however long you want based on what makes sense in your brain. I personally do like to decorate it so it‚Äôs like‚Ä¶fun.

If they have any knowledge of statistics though, they would be stupid or negligent to pretend that their experiences are the norm, or to advise everyone to do the same.\n\nSure, we all MIGHT be one of the few whose adhd is pretty much cured by medication, but if everyone assumes that then most people will be bitterly disappointed, and / or addicted. If everyone assumes that they are going to react normally to adhd meds (euphoria at the beginning, wearing down to a subtle effect - or no positive effect  on this particular type) then everyone is realistically prepared for the most probable outcome, and if it works better than expected, that's a pleasant surprise."

I did some individual therapy then group therapy and found group therapy to be awesome. They arm you with strategies to manage specific problems for you. They're not all going to work for you, so you have to also have to figure out what will. Though I did notice that the main practice my therapist taught was of mindful meditation. He said it was to teach our overactive brains how to be bored. Makes sense. It's also hella hard but I think that's the point. Whenever your ADHD kicks in hella hard, you can train your brain to slow down and think.\n\nTons of great books out there. I have trouble getting through a book that doesn't grab my attention, personally, but some recognize that and try and make it 'readable' for people with ADHD. \n\nThere's also an ADHD podcast I've listened to.\n\nOne thing I still suck at is sleep. Still trying to develop nightly habits to get me into bed before midnight...\n\nAnd exercise. Release dopamine, which our brains lack so we feel satisfied. For me... I'm always jumping from thing to thing without feeling good about any of it. I'm searching for that dopamine-fueled feeling of pleasure. Even though Its hard to find the motivation to exercise (classes or set times help), I recognize that I feel great after I do.\n\nSo... It's a lot of hard work. Difficult tasks. New habits. But ADHD is hard. It's difficult. And doesn't make me feel good about myself. So I'm working at it.\n\nPs. I'm on Vyvanse and I did not have the same feeling of clarity many feel on meds. It's more subtle. It's more like... I can tell when I'm NOT on it. Or rather... My partner can tell... I'm more chaotic and all over the place when I talk to her. It gives me a bit more calm but I've never ever felt \"omg it's like I'm wearing glasses for the first time and I can see everythingggggg\"."

HOWEVER, I‚Äôm also not entirely convinced that every ‚Äúnormal‚Äù brain forgetful or disorganized person you described don‚Äôt have ADHD either. A doctor can tell you you don‚Äôt have ADHD, but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you don‚Äôt have it.\n\nThere are lots of reasons why a Doctor will deny you a accurate diagnosis: they choose not to believe the countless studies, they don‚Äôt think it exists, they think the patient is claiming ADHD so they can get stimulants for their addiction (despite there being absolutely no history of it), the patient is female and there for cannot have ADHD (no really, doctors pull that shit), the doctor does not see patient behaving in a stereotypically ADHD way or patient can‚Äôt focus on work but can focus on video games and therefore patient must not have ADHD (even though countless studies show that you can have ADHD without being stereotypically ADHD and still being able to focus on video games, the one of few things that is scientifically designed to be mentally stimulating in the first place). Doctors do and often misdiagnose people with ADHD as having depression, having anxiety, or choose to not diagnose them at all, invalidate their experiences, and insult their character in one foul swoop.\n\n‚ÄúNormal‚Äù people can skip out on their to-do list and pick it up tomorrow. People with ADHD acknowledge the to-do list, know the to-do list needs to be done, know there are consequences if they don‚Äôt do it but physically cannot bring themselves to do it that day, the next, or the day after that.\n\nIt may not always be easy for a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person to finish their to-do list but their obstacles still are no where close to what ADHD people have to go through. \n\nEveryone has their baggage and difficulty. But don‚Äôt get it twisted. Being occasionally forgetful, or being disorganized because work got hectic is NOT the same as having a disability that literally makes organizing your desk on a slow day like climbing Mount Everest."

If I just take the medicine with no goal that I need to focus on, it‚Äôs not as noticeable. Medicine can give you the power to focus but it‚Äôs up to you where you wanna put that energy. There‚Äôs day where I plan on being productive, take the medicine, and then end up spending hours on social media. It‚Äôs hard to navigate. If you still have issues, you may need to increase the dose you‚Äôre taking. And in the case you‚Äôre taking other medications like antidepressants, these can reduce the effectiveness. If I take adderall with lexapro, I feel it cancels out imo. It could be that something else is reducing the effectiveness. Also, diet can play a role. It might be worth telling your symptoms to your doctor and getting a blood test (most covered by insurance!) I‚Äôm waiting to find out if I‚Äôm B12 deficient currently, which can play a role in attention. I‚Äôve also noticed that my ADHD meds are more effective when I eat a good meal, esp meals with protein. Protein shakes with your meds might help.

There are antidepressants like Wellbutrin that are known for adding energy and stims like mondafinil that are used to treat narcolepsy. But low energy can have a lot of medical reasons and there are many treatment options. You should really followup with your doc and make sure to get to the bottom of it."

From what i gather ppl are split 50/50 on it.\n\nPersonally I need amphetamine based, concerta was bad for me didn‚Äôt help made me foggy headed snd liek emotionally numb, then tried vyvanse, worked a lot better than concerta, but it was just like eh yeah i mean it‚Äôs better but nothin crazy. then adderall XR, worked pretty good but nothin special. then finally adderall ir, 10mg, works amazing \n\nmood is stabilized i can focus, and direct my focus on what i need to and actively be able to switch focus easily, i have better impulse control, i‚Äôm more calm mentally and my thoughts are organized instead of my mind being flooded with lots of different thoughts and being mentally disorganized. It helps with my depression and anxiety pretty well too (those can be caused and/or worsened by adhd)\n\nmy adderall helps me in every aspect of my life pretty much, and very significantly too\n\nbeware tho, ime most doctors and psychs don‚Äôt really have that well of an understanding of adhd and treating it etc. First doc just gave up and sent me to a psych nurse practitioner cuz the concerta didn‚Äôt work, and he started me at the highest dose. i could go on,\n\nbut you‚Äôll want to find wether u need the amphetamine based or methylphenidate based meds,\n\nthen once ur on a med that‚Äôs if ur ideal type, u want to try starting at the lowest dose, try it for a couple days maybe, then try the next dose, and so on. u should land on a dose that works good, and if u go a dose higher u get side effects and it dosent work as good, and if u go lower it won‚Äôt work as good. \n\nsee i started with 5mg ir adderall, kinda worked but not that well, 10mg worked very well, 15mg good too but maybe a bit high, 20mg too much, feel some stimulation and i hyper focus, no high or euphoria or anything tho. so i concluded 10mg is my ideal dosage, after i got the 10s i did the rest of the experimenting on my own as no doc i‚Äôve met really knows about this but this is the proper way to do it as u can find everywhere online, in articles and study‚Äôs written by docs and psychs etc.\n\nu gotta do some of the work on ur own, but the docs will help get u started by diagnosing u and getting u started on a med"

Dopamine increase doesn't stimulate euphoria, but euphoria does stimulate dopamine release!\n\nSometimes we can mistake high motivational salience for something akin to euphoria, but real euphoria is a very sensory experience (though generated chemically, not by our actual senses)\n\n\nEdit: I don't really understand the down vote because it's true"

I started in my 40s so I noticed things more quickly . The long-long term effects are not known because studies are only 4 weeks long and it‚Äôs the first generation that will grow up taking it for decades . So it seems pretty safe , but it affects circulation by narrowing your blood vessels , that‚Äôs why many of us develop cold or painful fingers and toes. Also sometimes gout , since it affects connective tissue, and hair thinning and loss . Not everybody all the time , but these are common side effects . Bottom line , keep seeing your doctors. Adults on stimulants is new territory . As much as I like Vyvanse and my friends their adderall , it is what it is ."

So we got to talking and she suggested Dexedrine. She looked up the dose options and said, but the highest dose is 15mg just fyi. I‚Äôm assuming that she assumed since it was the highest dose, it would match up, or maybe because it was and ER she could only prescribe me 1. \nBut after doing some research, I (think) I‚Äôve found that you can be prescribed more than one Dexedrine ER."

The prison system is more harmful to a person then the drugs in most cases, and prison is the only stick used in most cases.

I am taking latuda as well, antipsychotics partially block the benefits of stimulants (sadly never mentioned by my psychs which has seeded some mistrust) so I do need the max dose. \n\nI am trying to restructure my habits, but it is so difficult. Having been so inattentive from around 12yo onward, they are really engrained in me. I had maybe 1 really solid semester of college out of 3 years. Diagnosed 4th semester and medicated halfway through. The meds would work, but meds don't solve everything.

    "comment": "If it helps, Vyvanse started okay for me but a couple months in and it felt like some kind of dollar store med. Too reliant on urine pH to be consistent, and thus not really reliable. I'd have what felt like a slow drip of some 5mg Adderall equivalent for hours and hours and then all of a sudden after drinking a bunch of water I'd get hit with what felt like an Adderall 50 all at once. Shot my heart from 65 resting pulse to 107. Tried it again two more times with partial doses and it seemed to always have to do with water intake. Prodrugs rely too much on variable body chemistry. Hell, I don't even like Adderall XR because I have to wait twiddling my crashing fatigue thumbs for 1.5 hours until the second dose finishes dissolving or whatever it does in there. \n\nAnyway, yeah, it's expensive but Vyvanse totally felt like dollar store meds to me. So you might not be missing out on much. Just if it helps. \n\nEither way, sucks we have to rely on insurance nonsense like this in America. Frustrating for sure."

It could conceivably cause local shortages, but I‚Äôm not sure if Canadian pharmacies would fill a controlled substance prescription for a US doctor on a regular basis except in some very limited circumstances, specifically those parts of the US where land access has to go across the border, and access to the rest of the US has to occur by ferry or boat.  There‚Äôs two communities I can think of that are like that, one is a chunk of Washington State that can only be accessed by land through BC, and the other is a chunk of Minnesota that has land access through Manitoba.\n\nI‚Äôm not sure what kind of import rules would apply to that.

    "comment": "I‚Äôm on vyvanse, and I‚Äôve read extensively about the pharmacokinetics. It ends up working very similarly to adderall XR. In other words, after 4 hours, it has pretty much all been released as amphetamine. So it doesn‚Äôt really last all day as they advertise. The half life of amphetamine is about 12 hours, so there will still be some left in your blood at the end of the day, but it will probably be below the threshold that it‚Äôs very effective. However, you can do ‚Äúwater dosing‚Äù (dissolve in water, it‚Äôs tasteless except the fillers that don‚Äôt dissolve and have a very slight taste) and take 3/4ths of your dose first thing in the morning and the other fourth of your dose 6 or 8 hours later to top off. You‚Äôd want about a 50 mg dose of vyvanse to be equivalent to 15 mg adderall (technically 45 mg, but they dose in increments of 10, so 40 or 50 mg are your options)."

All the gate keepers that charge me to get access to my medicine, and who would throw someone in prison for not following the \"rules\" set by some old Boomers in Washington. \n\nIf a pharmacists would ever contact authorities for drug use, or keep someone from accessing the medicine they need, they are part of the problem. I don't know how anyone can live with themselves if they deny someone medicine because of the phoney war on drugs. I can understand that it's good money being a dealer, but cant understand the delusional beliefe that they are acting out of benevolence.. I just see a gate keeper who makes my day harder and gets paid to enforce drug laws.\n\nI couldn't do it. People are to blame for their part in facilitating the system."

Thanks so much for sharing!! \n\nDear ,\n\nI was recently diagnosed with ADHD and have come learn that there is a shortage of the critical medications that allow many of us with this condition to function day-to-day, in large part because the Drug Enforcement Agency has refused to issue the authorizations needed for the manufacturers to increase the production of Adderall and related medications.\n\nI came to be diagnosed with ADHD because of repetitive struggles I encountered in all areas of my life but especially at work. My medication management plan in combination with therapy has been life changing for me. Not only has it allowed me to thrive in the workplace and excel but with my medication I am better equipped to contribute more to my community and the world. With the shortage, getting access to my medication has been extremely difficult and has affected both my personal and professional wellbeing. \n\nI ask you to inquire into this and, if you find it to be true, to introduce legislation directing the DEA (and, if warranted, the Food and Drug Administration) to immediately issue the necessary authorizations to allow the needed increase in production.\n\nThank you for your time and for your attention to this matter.\n\nYours respectfully,"

    "comment": "This was roughly 2 summers ago I believe. This was just months before Arbor made their merger with Azurity Pharmaceuticals. Arbor was the sole manufacturer of all Zenzedi besides their low dose 5mg and 10mg tablets which were being manufactured by their subsidiary company Wilshire Pharmaceuticals. I called Azurity‚Äôs main line which is (678) 334-2420‚Ä¶ you press ‚Äú3‚Äù at the main menu, and then ‚Äú3‚Äù again which will direct you to patience assistance. At that time nothing was on back order, my pharmacy just couldn‚Äôt get it from their wholesalers so a rep was able to send the 20mg prescription I had directly to the pharmacy in my hometown. They responded to me by email and also called me directly the same day I spoke with the patient help line.\n\nI just called them a few minutes ago to see what the status of things were and was told the 20mg Zenzedi is on back order currently and will be back in stock on March 6th. She requested my email and phone number and sent my complaint to a higher up who will be reaching out to me at some time today. \n\nThis is what I would recommend doing if you are having issues finding a way to fill your meds!\n\n- Sidenote- I did find a pharmacy 2 days ago that happened to have a stock of a generic 10mg Dex made by Sunrise Pharmaceuticals. They had a patient who was on this med that longer takes it and had left overs from his last order and had enough on hand to fill my monthly dosage amount‚Ä¶ **These generics are garbage** They make me feel tired and just overall ‚Äúweird‚Äù at equivalent dosage, and higher dosage doesn‚Äôt feel any stronger. The key factor with name brand Zenzedi is that is has a non active ingredient in them called ‚ÄúCrosprovidone‚Äù which aids in the metabolization process of the active ingredient. THIS is what makes name brand Zenzedi far superior to all the generic Dex that is available. Just an fyi in case you have to fill your script with a generic‚Ä¶ it will not satisfy the same as Zenzedi (or it‚Äôs authorized generic Wilshire brand)\n\nHope that helps and best of luck !"

She could just as easily discontinue the medication of these \"patients\" who harass pharmacists over their medication and request that they seek treatment elsewhere if it's just a \"nice to have.\" (bitch being on adderall is the first time my brain has worked normally since i was like 8 years old and even then I was a social outcast who was too weird for social interaction!) \n\nthese people need to be rooted out so that others do not have to put up with their irrational behavior. She seems like someone who's losing control and lashing out at patients is the worst way she could handle this. \n\nRead up on the [APA ethics primer](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/Ethics/principles-medical-ethics.pdf). She is probably violating several guidelines at once in this single interaction alone. Contact her license board. If she's so afraid of losing her license, then maybe she's doing something actually shady and shifting blame to people who don't get their Rx on time. (MY PCP is terrible about this! I had to wait nearly a week because they just *didn't send the fucking script)*"

    "comment": "First and foremost, request that your previous psychiatrist provide a handoff summary to any new prescriber you see. Having a good handoff will ensure that your 8 years of history with a specific medication dosing is understand as reasonable.\n\nSecondly, unless she is independent, file a complaint with her company. Then file a complaint against her license with the Board of Medicine in your state. Bonus Fun fact, if you file a yelp/ google review, she can't dispute your assertions or she risks violating HIPAA.\n\nDon't use emotionally charged language in the complaint. State facts. What can't you do when your ADHD is unmanaged? When/ what time did the incident occur? Use direct quotes when possible. Were I you, I'd write my complaint to look something like this:\n\n\"I had an appointment with Schmuckatelli MD on 6/17/2022 to revisit my transition of care with her as I didn't believe she had consulted with my previous mental health physician regarding my prescription for dexedrine IR. Per my previous physician's notes it was well established that at baseline I use 40-60mg/ day to manage my symptoms; Schmuckatelli MD only prescribed me 30mg Dexedrine IR daily. \n\nWhen I attempted to express my concerns with Schmuckatelli she was immediately hostile to my request and and accused me of being \"needy\" and compared me to an addict. She also stated that the medications I use to manage my ADHD were not a \"need\", but just \"nice to have\". In this same appointment Schmuckatelli informed me that she was worried about her license and insinuated that her license is more important than managing her patient's mental disorders. \n\nBased off of my interaction with Schmuckatelli I do not believe this physician is adhering current evidence based practices regarding managing psychotropic medications. My livelihood and quality of life is dependent on me being able to function. I don't even feel safe driving without the benefit of my ADHD medications. I can't believe I was treated so callously by a psychiatrist who advertises that she specializes in working with adult ADHD patients.\n\nPlease advise me if I can clarify my complaint, and please notify me of the complaint's progress.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nExclufi"

ADHD is a medical condition because we don't have the chemicals made by our body that our brain needs to function properly. It is no different than a diabetic needing insulin but because it is considered a mental health condition, some people, including doctors, act like we can click our heels 3 times and the chemicals our brain needs will magically manifest themselves and we can function. We had a similar issue with my husband getting his meds and I was told if they couldn't verify that he wasn't working or in school full time, they would not prescribe ADHD meds. He is medically retired military but he still needs to function! We were considering using an out of network doctor that was adult ADHD friendly, paying for it ourselves and then submitting a claim to his insurance for at least partial reimbursement. Thankfully, we found out the VA doctors will prescribe ADHD meds (we had no clue they would) so he went that route. If I were you, I would schedule a phone call with the new doctor for a consultation prior to an appointment to make sure their practice philosophy matches up with what your needs are and then ask them if they have any restrictions on prescribing ADHD meds to adults when clinically indicated and if they are only willing to prescribe a maximum dosage even if it is not delivering any therapeutic benefits because you need a higher dose. I would also ask if they agree with the DSM-5 definition of ADHD (some doctors surprisingly don't). If not, don't waste anymore time with that doctor.

Your ombudsmen should be able to get you a different doctor that will work with your plan in a case like this. \n\n\nFourth- call your old doctor and tell them what's up. Maybe they can accept your insurance or get at least the process started to accept your insurance. If they can't, they may be able to give you a sliding scale price for visits. \n\nLastly - depending on your HR dept and company- tell your HR what's going on and ask when insurance is going to change. If the company has heard enough complaints about poor providers covered under the plan provider, they may be more inclined to change insurance providers. One of the big reasons people leave jobs is because of health insurance. \n\n\n\nIf you went to this provider with an existing diagnosis and medication regiment that worked, they never should have messed with it.

I think most doctors are just kinda insulted, that people come in their with their own treatment plans.. Adderall is slightly more addictive, that being said I've been on it for 25 years of my 30 year old life. So I try to not step on toes, but I will say if I come in asking about a brand, when they clearly see a record of having been prescribed it.. I get all shit eyed, I haven't ever had a doc treat me with that disrespect, in the same purposes I'd respond well most doctors are happy to receive a dollar from me but learning you can't just be a prick to everyone, look at your history.. try to give them the benefit, but that was unprofessional as hell what they said... now as to anything that we can do about it?

Don't give up. Be patient. It f-ing sucks, but adhd sucks worse. And don't put your energy into more negative shit like anything strictly from resentment that won't get you to your goals any quicker. The world right now needs hope and especially people with adhd, anything else is wasted energy. \n\nTrust me, being on nothing a few times for months, one realizes that anything is better than nothing.....\nAnd work up from there. Find another dr somehow. Call somewhere where they just give you anyone and catch the one that believes you. Then only see them. Think outside the box. \nThese are brutal times, I also have Asperger's and some BPD or unipolar dpr, not important bc my adhd meds work on those too (a little).\nBut you gotta be positive and stick with it.

Bear in mind this is only my opinion, but by mentioning that you're not trying to get revenge, you're poisoning the well; the reader is going to be introduced to the idea you are seeking revenge just by you brining it up. Regan famously did that in one of his speeches around the time people questioned somebody so old running for POTUS:\n\n> \"I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy experience having worked with the type of people who review complaints at licensing boards is they skim the complaint and fill out a form with subsection headers like \"complaint type\", \"harm type\", etc. You're going to grab their attention by throwing in healthcare buzz words like \"evidence based practice\". Additionally, focusing on what you *can't do* as a result of poor service you focus the reviewer's attention on how you are measurably being harmed. You establish a valid reason to complain and tell the reviewer a core competency that your provider is deficient on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, all just my opinion.

I was able to get diagnosed my someone else in their practice so my dr agreed to start me on meds anyway while I waited on the nine month waitlist for a different psych. \n\nUnfortunately my dr was horrible, required me to come in every month and would cancel my apts with little or no notice and leave me without meds for a week or two. She actually got fired for unrelated things within a few months and the new dr is amazing. He actually listens, gives suggestions about what he thinks we should do with my meds but defers 100% to me if I have something I want to try. Apts every three months, every other apt is telehealth. \n\nI can also send anyone I want to pick up my meds at the pharmacy if I need to, so if I‚Äôm working all week until after they close I can have my bf go in and I don‚Äôt have to worry about it. \n\nI would urge you to move on from any practitioner as soon as you can if they are not providing the care you need. I spent eight years from the time I started seeing professionals until I was diagnosed and I knew I was sticking around with dr‚Äôs that weren‚Äôt really helping for far too long just bc I couldn‚Äôt deal with the process all over again.

    "comment": "In Australia we have a hybrid public/private system. Most doctors work in both systems, some days at a hospital somewhere, some days in their own private practice. I'm not sure how it fits in with your insurance model, so I'll just throw out some details and hope it makes sense.\n\nIf I wanted to, I could go through the public system (i.e. hospitals) and pay very little for treatment, however it will take a very long time for things to happen. I've suffered too long to put myself through that, but if I couldn't afford it, I'd definitely be going this route.\n\nThe other way, is to have my GP write a referral letter to a specialist, in this case a psychiatrist. I call them up asking for an appointment, send referral etc, and if they decide they want to see me, they'll agree to the appointment. When it comes time to pay, they bill me their full rate. Medicare will automatically pay me back some portion of that, which will be the same as what they would have paid the doctor if I saw them in a hospital, and I pay the difference (called a gap here). My private health insurance doesn't contribute anything at this point, I don't think they pay for doctors, only \"services\" or \"treatments\".  \n\nWhen I get my scripts filled, the pharmacies refer to them as private scripts, and I also pay full price for them there, but for these my private health insurance does reimburse me some portion of them. \n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nBut really, as the other poster mentioned, a doctor typically doesn't care how he gets paid, as long as it is a rate he's happy with. Insurance companies work by offering a fixed rate for a service to doctors, and they accept or not (or have a gap). If you're happy to just pay the whole amount, then everything is easier for *you*, it just costs more."

The smaller boost in dopamine helps regulate and effectively slow down our thoughts enough that we can sleep easier, and since we tend not to get awesome sleep at night anyway in my experience that usually means lights out. Sleepiness should be a pretty quick indicator the dose prescribed isn‚Äôt providing enough and it needs to be increased. We‚Äôre just out here looking to function. \n\nI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too much to expect that if you‚Äôre treating someone with ADHD you research and have at least a basic understanding of how our brains work vs. NTs. Hop on YouTube and watch some Russell Barkley lectures on how our brains work chemically and functionally and medications like so many of us are forced to do because our medical professionals can‚Äôt be bothered üò≠"

Not a lawyer but might be worth getting a consult (med mal typically work on contingency, so no cost up front). OP should have been able to get their prescription history and show their doctor. can't tell whether the doc had OP's history but the follow-up should not have gone like that.\n\nEven if a lawyer won't take the case, OP's insurance would probably love to hear about this. They shouldn't be paying for a second visit in a month if it was more or less \"no care given, problem not addressed. Additional care sought\""

She worked out of her husband‚Äôs practice but they didn‚Äôt share receptionist/front desk ‚Ä¶so it was impossible to get a hold of her. She also took two month off every year so it was my job to ration my meds for those two months. \n\nI can‚Äôt even remember how I found circle medical but I‚Äôve been super happy. I ‚Äúsee‚Äù the same doc every month and she‚Äôs super nice and answers all my questions. It‚Äôs way more personal and friendly and I feel comfortable with her. My previous doc - I don‚Äôt think she cared. She just wanted my money/business. My circle med Doc makes me feel like she actually cares about me. \n\nI did have to try and get old records and such from my old doc to my new one, but I don‚Äôt think that happened. \n\nOnce I was happy and doing well on meds/dosage I was able to push appts to every other month or every three months. \n\nIf I have an issue between appts I can send a msg through the app. If they need something from me they can also msg me through the app. I get reminders for my appts on my phone. \n\nIt‚Äôs seriously been a god send. I hope it‚Äôs the same for you. It was too daunting for me to try and find another in network provider and get an appt within a few months. And I didn‚Äôt want to go back to my shitty old doc either. I may have lucked out with a good, caring, knowledgeable doc on circle medical who makes me feel\nComfortable. \n\nI‚Äôm billed online and can pay online. \n\nRx goes directly to my pharmacy. And when I get a text to let me know it‚Äôs ready, I can also pay for it online and then go pick up. So easy. \n\nI think the ease of it all is so helpful for those with adhd. I always have my phone. I can do my appts from anywhere. I get reminders. \n\nJust give it a try! if you don‚Äôt like who you get. After the appt, msg through the app to say thank you and ask if you could possibly have a diff doc next time because you‚Äôre looking for a better fit or someone you‚Äôre more comfortable with."

I haven't had to be on it in years, but with my new job, I'm doing a lot of repetitive menial data entry and it's a lot like the schoolwork that I had so much trouble with back in my teens. I'd really like to know what changes there have been in ADHD medication- back when I was on it, it was still called ADD- and what works best for adults.\"  \n\nHe tried to sell me on Vyvanse, but my insurance wouldn't cover it. So he called in a generic adderal prescription for me and we set up a follow-up to talk about it a month later.  \n\nNo psychologist appointment needed at all. Same with my depression meds: the first time I saw him, I told him what I'd been on for the last 10+ years and he just called in the prescription after checking that I was doing okay and reminding me that anti-depressants work best in combination with therapy.  \n\nIt really blows my mind when I hear these stories about it being difficult to get medication. The most difficulty I've had is getting it covered by my insurance. I had a bit of pushback from my previous GP when getting the anti-depressant prescription. They wanted a script written by a psychologist, but they wrote refill scripts after that. But then again, my state is the worst when it comes to prescription drug abuse. I was given mounds of oxycodone when I had kidney stones. Maybe there's a happy medium somewhere."

Also there are doctors that are totally hostile towards anybody taking this type of medication and subscribe to the old \"you just need to try harder\" way of thinking. \n\nPoint is, it's not easy or possible for everyone and we are both lucky that we've had a relatively easy time with our docs. Also, having been through this before, we know what to say, how to act, etc that others don't have the benefit of. You are right tho, it should be a happy medium, and that certainly exists somewhere, because not every single person has this disorder, and not every single person needs medication, but there are plenty out there going totally unmedicated and without assistance dealing with it... neither should be true statements in an ideal world."

I've been on this since a kid, day in day out.. 20mg X 3 was still in FDA dosing guidelines, but they said it had to be 2 times a day only.. my doctor called back with 1 1/2 20 mg x 2 cause everything is \"back ordered\" they finally just try to aggravate the situation by quoting fine amounts from the DEA, all while having their children dispense the medications.. none of us asked to be on this medicine, in the first place.. I came back to it after a break and asked, cause I feel fucked without it.. but speaking from both angles, if you can help it.. try not to even get on this ride, cause motivation will never improve by consistently blasting dopamine.. even when I got a brand script now.. there's nothing therapeutic .. also never take a doctors judgments personally, there are amazing ones out there, and then the ones who did career day at highschool and only looked at the paycheck when deciding, keep searching you'll know you found it, when you feel like bursting out into tears cause its the first doctor that made you feel like you got this thing we call life subsequently, I've went from needing more meds.. to less\n\nIt's in my own opinion that this won't get resolved until FDA/DEA sees funding slashed cause everyone's unfocused with hurt backs..

    "comment": "Vyvanse is supposed to last around as long as XR d-amphetamine and XR adderall if they are all at equivalent dosages. If vyvanse doesn‚Äôt last as long for you as XR formulations of amphetamine then just take the XR , and it‚Äôs because there is variation in the way people metabolize these formulations. Whether it‚Äôs XR d-amphetamine or the XR amphetamine formulation inside adderall isn‚Äôt going to effect duration or even effects that much ‚Ä¶ because adderall is mostly d-amphetamine anyways. Vyvanse is supposed to be the most consistent release throughout the day but it totally depends on your body converting it and the dosage so it‚Äôs not really a given."

    "comment": "i had no experience with Adderall but can comment on Dexedrine vs. Vyvanse. I‚Äôm currently on Dexedrine but tried out Vyvanse for a bit in the past since it was suggested by my doctor when i was looking for something that wouldn‚Äôt wear out in 3-4 hours. I also take Venlafaxine XR for depression, and would take my first dose of Dexedrine/ Vyvanse with Venlafaxine in the morning.\n\nDexedrine has its pros and cons. So far it‚Äôs the only thing that significantly improved my productivity and make me stay truly focused the entire time - i feel like i could get 5x more work done when i took Dexedrine and it doesn‚Äôt give me too much anxiety. Cons: Dry mouth (could be improved by drinking water constantly), faster heart rate, decreased appetite (I recently started taking Dexedrine regularly again, and i can notice how my body doesn‚Äôt desire food as much) and since it‚Äôs fast-acting, i always have to retake my 2nd dose mid-day to stay productive during my 9-5. i tried Dexedrine Spansule (the long-acting form) before but it didn‚Äôt work as well and i was much less productive vs. when i‚Äôm on regular Dexedrine, so I decided to stick with the fast-acting one instead. last thing i don‚Äôt like about Dexedrine is how i‚Äôll need to increase my dosage every 3-6 months, since once my body gets used to the current dosage that i‚Äôm on Dexedrine gets less effective and they had to increase my dosage to help me improve my productivity. I started out on 5mg a day and 2 years later i was at 40mg a day. at one point i also had trouble sleeping too, so i adjusted my afternoon intake to a lower dosage and was able to sleep better again.\n\nVyvanse was recommended to me by my doctor because I wanted something slow-acting since i didn‚Äôt wanna retake my medication throughout the day (he said it should typically lasts between 13-14 hrs) and I started out on a mid dose (30mg i believe). although it gave me terrible side effects: dizzy, dry mouth, diarrhea, and wasn‚Äôt as effective compared to Dexedrine (i was probably only half as focused as I could be), but it did stay on for longer. unfortunately the dizziness and diarrhea didn‚Äôt seem to go away after 2 weeks in. I also hate the fact that it didn‚Äôt make me as productive compared to Dexedrine so I asked to be switched back to Dexedrine and have been finding ways to work around to make my experience with Dexedrine more pleasant (drinking a lot of water, not taking a huge dose in the afternoon so i wouldn‚Äôt have trouble falling asleep, eating smaller meals but more frequently to make sure i‚Äôm still eating).\n\nin the end both medication gave me a boost in productivity (Dexedrine was definitely a better choice for productivity however) but since my mind tends to wonder A LOT and work requires more focus time nowadays, I think Dexedrine was a better choice given my own needs even when it requires pretty frequent top up. also its side effects were more tolerable than Vyvanse‚Äôs. if possible, discuss with your doctor to see if you can try Dexedrine and compare your experience with Vyvanse/ Adderall and pick the one that works best for you. your medication should also suit your needs (my priority was productivity boost) and the side effects shouldn‚Äôt bother you all the time, and everyone reacts to meds differently so make sure you carefully discuss this with your doctor beforehand. hope this helps!"

I am more calm after taking the pill, but no noticeable ‚Äúmotivation‚Äù. I do get things done as always, but before I was burning myself & relying on extreme anxiety, now less so.(still don‚Äôt wanna do my assignments lol)\nI noticed the effect wearing of after like six hours or so, and my doctor suggested that I should try splitting the dose, take half of the dose after getting up and half 3 hrs later. In separate capsules of course haha. I haven‚Äôt try it yet but I think it might help! You can ask your doctor to prescribe 2x capsules in half the dose.\nAlso! Lay off the vitamine C, at least an hour before or later when you take Vyvanse, I read it somewhere that it can reduce the effects. \nHope it helps :)"

It also makes it slower, so if \"didn't work\" means it kept you up at night, then the regular version could be worth trying.\n\nIf you had a bad reaction though, something other than dose too low or too high, yeah, low odds dextroamphetamine is the med for you. \n\nOn the other hand, if you like OJ in the morning, lisdextroamphetamine (Vyvanse) is absorbed in the gut, so it would be okay with that but with normal amphetamines what I read is that too much citric acid makes them not work as well."

The negative feedback we get through out our life can be a very tough teacher and some of us try and manage to compensate for our shortcomings. I believe medication abuse is on the rise as well so professionals might be getting very conscious about diagnosis. \n\nI‚Äôm proud of your determination and celebrating your achievement with you üéâ"

Of course I pushed back that my success was due to the steady script of stimulants I‚Äôd been taking since the early 90‚Äôs that he was now giving me trouble about. \n\nHe kept citing some study. I made him send it to me. It was about adult-onset ADHD being mostly just symptoms from other issues rather than actual ADHD. I read to him the giant disclaimer in the fucking abstract that this study was not relevant to anyone who had symptoms in childhood (I was dx‚Äôd at 5!), and then I fired his ass and told him he needs to learn how to read a damn study. \n\nAnyway I‚Äôm glad you had this kind of success and it‚Äôll be amazing if they‚Äôre better informed for the next patient!!!"

    "comment": "I got diagnosed earlier this year when I approached my doctor about it. Oddly enough, I would have never thought about it if it were two people I know didn't begin talking about it; their life experiences and symptoms were eerily similar to my own. \n\nWe had similar tendencies - zoning out when talking to people, forgetfulness, anxiety, and depression - not being able to get shit done unless we were super interested in it. Procrastination and various other things. \n\nMy PCP was a bit doubtful at the time, but it humored me any ways and I filled out a 4 page questionnaire that went back to childhood stuff, daily life, and questions my parents had to answer.  I think a lot of people think they have ADHD so they have an excuse to be lazy and underachieving. Same thing when people say, \"Oh my OCD is acting up. \"...very annoying. (I also stopped my anti depressants at the time because they weren't working and just made me crave sugary shit.)\n\nAnyways he didn't even tally up my score because it was so high, lol! And was like \"Well seeing your answers, I'm fairly certain you're right. Let's give this medication a try. Call me in a week. Let me know how you feel. \"\n\nTried meds for a week, and literally, it was like putting my glasses on for the first time. My anxiety and depression were gone, I felt in control of my day, I could focus on work (I managed a gym at the time for my inlaws) my emotions finally felt regulated and my thoughts weren't bouncing around all day long.  \n\nEven looking back on my childhood and early education, teachers often told my parents I was \"bright\" just lacked attention and needed more focus. When I spoke to my mom about this, she said she did take me to our PCP at the time when I was in elementary school because she knew something was wrong but couldn't figure it out. She ended up being dismissed by our PCP (they didn't recognize girls at the time could have ADHD)  which is also interesting because a teacher told my mom my brother had it and the doctor was dismissive of that to. (He's also been diagnosed recently)\n\nI wish I had been diagnosed as a child. I took this all very hard for a while because I kept thinking, \"What could I have accomplished?\"  It's all water under the bridge now, I think I've done well anyways I have an advanced diploma in health care and I'm in university now for health sciences....I really feel like the sky is the limit.  I'm 33 years now and would have liked to have completed my education before this age so I could enjoy my life more. \n\nI still struggle with self-esteem and confidence, though, and hard-core imposter syndrome, mostly due to the majority of teachers in elementary  and high school , getting frustrated with me and believing I was stupid. I had a teacher tell me I'd be scrubbing toilets the rest of my life at mc donalds.\n\n I had two teachers one in elementary school that told my parents I was gifted but couldn't bring it out in myself and an English teacher in higschool and pushed me into university level English and said I had no business being in lower level classes in high-school.  \n\nYou'll see a big difference if you stay on meds. It sounds like you're very successful now, I'm sure it'll only get better now with the appropriate diagnosis."

Even though you‚Äôre already high-functioning, you will struggle less to maintain it and you will enjoy your life more with treatment. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre finding this already. \n\nKudos to your psychologist for owning up to a mistake, in light of new evidence, and explaining why they made it in the first place.\n\nLots of us are relatively ‚Äúhigh functioning‚Äù and successful even without a diagnosis and treatment; it‚Äôs absolutely NOT a diagnostic criteria, on its own, either way (someone who can‚Äôt get their shit together doesn‚Äôt automatically have ADHD either). We can learn to put systems in place and compensate for our dysfunctional brains to some extent, but it never ceases to be a struggle, and a lot of unnecessary trauma can come of that (both for ourselves and sometimes for those around us).\n\nAlso, even those of us with fairly severe symptoms can often stay on-task and get things done *if the consequences for failing are severe enough*. For instance, I spent 4 years in the military and was generally able to show up on time, keep my room clean, and otherwise do what was expected of me.

I made good grades, mostly, and got good reviews at work, but I had really bad problems that screwed up my life in ways I could hide from people, for YEARS, and it only got worse with age. And that‚Äôs even after being on meds‚Ä¶had I not had to work full time, I may have been able to get therapy/coaching on how to function w/adhd as it presented itself in my life. \n\nDrugs are not enough. Unfortunately TIME is a major issue w/adhd‚Ä¶ the lack of this precious resource as well as the management of it, work against you. I really believe trained coaches/ therapists would help, but that‚Äôs hard to fit into a work schedule or financial situation. \n\nBut not ALL types of therapy would help. Your medical professionals need to be adequately up-to-date on adhd. Some of them don‚Äôt even believe it‚Äôs a thing and don‚Äôt know it impacts adults differently than children, or men differently than women, or that a woman can face extremely more severe symptoms after menopause. Some of them are as bad as uneducated people, thinking you are just making excuses. My psychiatrist was wonderful. She recognized I had it after numerous sessions with her, and was supportive, even worked with me on getting the right mix of meds, but she‚Äôs retired, then deceased, and the whole psych field is so different than her, now. She really cared about her patients quality of life. That concept is gone from the medical field now."

Especially because I had to wait a few weeks for each one to build up and ‚Äústart working‚Äù (which they didn‚Äôt), and then endure several dose increases with each one until I reached the max dose and still wasn‚Äôt seeing any benefits. Then, tapering off each one and starting the next. Meanwhile, my doc had also taken me off my lexapro because she thought that was what was making me so tired (spoiler: it wasn‚Äôt and my anxiety was THROUGH THE ROOF throughout this ordeal). I can only imagine what my brain chemistry was doing, being introduced to and maxed out on SNRI‚Äôs after being tapered off too quickly from a long term SSRI, and having other drugs introduced and taken away too. The whole summer was a brutal, fucked up rollercoaster for me (mentally/emotionally).\n\nIt sucks that they make us jump through so many hoops to get the medications we need. I also had to sign a contract (prohibiting me from taking any other drugs, even weed which is legal in my state) and do a blood and urine test to ‚Äúprove‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt abusing my concerta script in the beginning in order to be able to take it long term. \n\nIt‚Äôs a good thing I‚Äôm stubborn about advocating for myself when it comes to my mental and physical health, because damn. I could see how all that shit would make someone newly diagnosed just give up and try to cope on their own. The concerta, when I finally got it, offered SUCH a huge improvement I couldn‚Äôt believe it! Unfortunately, my energy levels and other symptoms are back. I just increased my concerta dosage, so I‚Äôm hoping that helps for a while. Idk what I‚Äôm gonna do if I have to switch meds when the concerta is at max dose and loses effectiveness. ü•≤"

So by the time I spoke with him I was genuinely able to say ‚Äúmy therapist recommended that I talk to you about adhd‚Äù and didn‚Äôt even have to mention the TikTok thing.

Adderall IR 30mg hurt my chest and knocked me out cold and I had no appetite, completely drenched. I am now on zenzedi I started with the 20 MG, my head fog cleared and I was randomly smiling?

It‚Äôll feel more effective.\n\nanother thing you can do is start taking magnesium supplements. amphetamines deplete magnesium from the body faster. magnesium is responsible for muscle relaxation and sleep. it also regulates the NMDA receptors in your brain, the same receptors associated with stimulant tolerance. \n\ntaking magnesium while on adderall can make it seem more effective, especially for people who are already magnesium deficient. fun fact, magnesium deficiency is incredibly common with more than 50% of Americans not getting the recommended dietary intake (RDI)"

Exercise, finding the correct diet for your specific needs, staying hydrated, and all that horrible, monotonous stuff might help the drugs be more efficient.

You will continue doing what ever you were doing at the point they start working.\n\nAll the meds do is remove the brain fog/noise of being focused on a task, and makes decisions not hurt your brain.\n\nThat's it. But that is also a lot. \n\nNow, if you'd been medicated as a child (I was diagnosed at 38, so I know the feeling), you would have been able to develop the proper habits and such. Instead, you are in the situation of needing to do so as an adult, when bad habits are deeply ingrained."

    "comment": "I've been on and off meds since I was diagnosed in my 20s and I'm still trying to find the right/effective balance. I put systems in place throughout school, college and work environments prior to diagnosis. I created these things to stay on task, since not doing so risked bad grades/failure, losing a job, etc. So I did it a little backwards I guess. At any rate, work (maybe with a ADHD-trained therapist?) to create some systems that will help you. Sometimes it's as simple as putting out your clothes for the next day the night before so you aren't left scrambling in the morning. Setting up routines like that (coffee maker with a timer, for example) definitely help reduce the cognitive load. \n\nOther things that have helped me with executive function have been: \n1) Getting OUTSIDE as much as possible. It sounds simple, but it works. It reduces stress and noise for our chatty brains and helps us reach homeostasis. Interesting fact I read about years ago - the rates of ADHD in German kids were incredibly low compared to the U.S. and they pointed to the time kids spent outdoors as the main reason why. They have the \"kinderwald\" - kindergarten in the woods. The kids spend all day (barring inclement weather) learning about their environment. \n\n2) Getting enough sleep - quality sleep. This has been a struggle since I had kids (shocker), but I take a prescription before bed that actually works (Trazadone - only 25mg). When I have gotten next to no sleep or low quality sleep, my brain is nothing but scrambled eggs. \n\n3) Regular exercise. This one can be tough to stick to, but I find that signing up for classes MAKES me go. I can't just blow it off or I get charged. Getting the blood flowing really helps my executive function. \n\nOne last thing - for one of my kids with ADHD - we found a therapist who uses DBT vs. CBT therapy. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (vs. Cognitive B.H.). A short blurb from the Cleveland Clinic: \n\"Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of talk therapy that helps people understand how thoughts affect emotions and behaviors. Dialectical means combining opposite ideas. DBT focuses on helping people accept the reality of their lives and their behaviors, as well as helping them learn to change their lives, including their unhelpful behaviors.\"\n\nI wish you luck finding what works for you!"

The meds help alot, but I am starting to feel like I am going to have to come to terms with the fact that my life will probably basically be a constant struggle just to barely scrape by, having to find a way to accomodate my messed up level at which I am able to function. I see the people in the comments talking about the ways that therapy can help, and pushing the idea that the issues with executive function are something that you can overcome with self-discipline and therapy, but I don't think that is the same for everyone. It is awesome that people are able to find success with that approach, but it feels like with a certain severity of adhd (or if other issues are also present) that it can end up being that for some, the problems end up interfering with being able to follow the practices that are meant to help said problems. It's like at what point does it cross into being actually disabilitating? Furthermore, how exactly do you tell, like at what point would you look at a person and decide that the severity of their adhd is such that you would say that person is disabled? Which, unless you are saying that adhd can not be severe enough to be disabilitating, I honestly think at a certain point, in some situations the only way to know is based on what a person says about what they experience.\n\nEdit: and sadly in those cases, with no answer, you basically either find a way to scrape by, be it with doing what you can to work around the issues or managing to get it reckognized as a disability to recieve assistance, or you end up homless and destitute as I am sure many unfortunately do."

    "comment": "One thing that has helped me find some more peace with meds just being a tool rather than a cure all is that there have been peer reviewed studies (I don‚Äôt have any handy but can find them if requested) that show being on meds longer term actually changes our brain mapping and neural pathways / brain structure. Meds aren‚Äôt an instant fix and we still have to put in outside effort but meds over time help thise changes compared to unmediated people.\n\nMany have suggested a therapist but if it is accessible to you, an occupational therapist versed in adhd can be life changing. They focus specifically on functional skills (executive dysfunction etc) but helping create systems and structures that work for you rather than emotional based skills like regulation. If it is specifically executive function you are looking to improve, they‚Äôre ace. They predominantly trained in things like helping people return to work and life post injury or illness such a stroke meaning they focus on increasing accessibility in someone‚Äôs life.\n\nI am sorry you‚Äôre having a rough time, it is never a good feeling. Having to still do more than our non-ADHD peers is exhausting and feels unfair but I try to remind myself not to compare and that I want to put in the extra work not to catch up with them, but to seek these skills to improve my own life and happiness. I deserve to do this for myself so I can live the life I want to.\n\nI also want to say that being disappointed and disheartened is totally understandable. Sit with those feelings, it‚Äôs okay to be tired and fed up and to want more, both from your meds and your life. Think about why you want more, the things you want to change and when you are ready, put your game face on and do what is within your capacity to create some of that change, one step at a time.\n\nFor me, it was realising that I wanted to bring more of my best self to my relationship and friendships so I could enjoy them more and move through my life with more calm than chaos. This is what keeps me motivated, and also what helps me stay more disciplined when I am not motivated. No one is perfect everyday, but I do bring my best everyday. Some days that looks like eating tater tots for every meal some days so I can rest, that‚Äôs okay too"

    "comment": "After being re-diagnosed at 54 (had a childhood diagnosis that was briefly treated and then ignored), I was prescribed Adderall. For me, it works as advertised.\n\nHowever, I promptly discovered something else. When it came to getting things done, my brain was filled with a lifetime of desperate coping skills, slipshod workarounds,  and badly patched software I used to muddle through, and none of that stuff served me well at all now that I could focus. In fact, it got in the way.\n\nWhat I had to do was re-learn how to work, how to get things done in an orderly and timely manner, and to do it consistently.\n\nHonestly, it went far beyond work. I had to re-learn how to live.\n\nMedication treats, but it doesn't teach.\n\nThere are a million books, videos, podcasts, etc., on how to tackle that. For myself, I'm keeping it as simple as I possibly can for now. I've made two signs out of index cards and taped them to the wall in my line of sight at my desk. One sign is just a 4-step list of things, specific to the work I do, that brings me into focus on what I need to do, blocked out in 5-10 minute chunks. It's basically just instructions for getting myself ready to work. I'm Texan, and so I call it my \"Fixing to Get Ready\" sign, which translates to English as \"getting ready to get ready.\"\n\nThe other sign is just instructions for the Pomodoro Method. That might sound like fancy stuff, until you discover that \"pomodoro\" is just Italian for \"tomato.\" An Italian guy had a little kitchen timer in the shape of a tomato, and he used that to break up every hour of work into smaller increments, with short breaks, and it worked. Turns out it works pretty well for a lot of people with ADHD.\n\nThey sell a thousand different versions of little timers on Amazon, many of them with added functionality for the Pomodoro Method and ADHD. I'm sure it's a real cash cow and largely unnecessary, but I bought one of the fancy ones for about $10, and I love it.\n\nAnyway, not everything works for everyone, and there are other options, but this one seems to work for me.\n\nAnother thing: I'm 54. I know at some point soon they won't want me taking stimulants anymore because they get concerned about heart issues that come with age. That, or the meds will become less effective with time, and they won't want to increase the dosage for those same reasons.\n\nI'm sure that's coming. So what I'm doing is learning habits and methods, like the timer thing, that will get me through, in little increments, with or without the meds. So, come the day, I'll still have those tools in my toolbox.\n\nGood luck!"

But something happened about a year into the medication that makes me wonder if they have been helping memory, but I just hadn't noticed. \n\nI forgot I was supposed to lead a meeting - one that was kind of important. I just totally spaced on it. So the meeting time rolls around, and I get my 2 minute warning on my phone. I'm not at my desk, I had been helping my mom with something. So I log into the meeting from my phone. Normally, that would have been fine, except this was MY meeting to screen share and lead. I hadn't prepared at all, and I couldn't share my screen to lead the conversation because I was in my car. I had to asses the situation and make a quick decision. 1. Get someone else to do it for me or 2. Apologize and reschedule. I went with option 2. Everyone was super understanding and honestly seemed happy to have the time back.\n\nAfter I hung up, I realized that while I felt mild panic at the moment I realized my mistake, it was mild. It wasn't so severe I couldn't get it together and take action. I didn't freeze, my stomach didn't flip. Something is different, because that should have sent me into full panic and shame mode. I would normally have spent at least the rest of that day beating myself up about it, probably more than that. I got in a lot of trouble as a kid for forgetting stuff and losing track of time, so I developed this sort of protective anxiety about forgetting to help me remember really important things. But I didn't feel that this time. I let this go. It wasn't a big deal. These things happen. \n\nSince Adderall is not anti-anxiety medication, I have to assume that I'm forgetting less small things overall, so if I do forget something, my brain is open to viewing it as a simple mistake, not an internal character flaw. That's my best theory at the moment anyway."
