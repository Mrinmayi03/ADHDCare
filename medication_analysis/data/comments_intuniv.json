I feel like once the 'high' of finally getting help started to wear off, that old habits started to creep back in, BUT they are much easier to control.\n\nI only drink when I feel like it. Cut down to once every two weeks or social events. Waking up and starting is much easier, as well as focusing and working for longer periods of time. Instead of staring at a screen for hours and going out for walks, I can sit and slowly build up momentum.\n\nSelf confidence and efficacy are both up. I don't have to think twice before speaking out. I don't think the medicine is creating these new conditions, but more that the voice that tells me I can't do something is easier to tame. A good example was looking at a job offer a few days and telling myself I wasn't good enough for it. Old me would have closed that tab. New me closed it, reopened it, and thought fuck it, give it a try. Still got rejected, hehe."

The shutdown already fucked me up big time I think, regardless, but everything has been particularly impossible for me ever since I actually got it. The lockdown was what felt like the best time of my entire life, understandably due to the fact that I literally had to do nothing outside of what I felt like doing and had an income that I didn’t need to work for, but I think that break really just broke my working streak and drive for success. Then, once I actually got sick, I haven’t been the same since, and I can’t find my way back to myself nor my brain or any modicum of functionality, meds or no meds.

    "comment": "I am so sorry that you and others are going through this! \n\nIMO, a year is not a slump, it'snow a state you're in that you need help out of, leaning on as many people and tools as possible (bear with me a minute as i know you'rehaving trouble motivating). \n\n1. Therapy: Can you increase the number of tines you talk to your therapist to once a week, at least for a while? You need help with moving yourself out of this space. Ask your doctor to screen you for depression and anxiety. They probably have a number of ways to do so. My psychiatrist had me fill out a paper screener that asked questions, and we took it from there. That and our appointments helped me get my ADHD dx at 47! \n\n2. Genomind test. My therapist asked me to consider doing a saliva test with a test provided by a company called Grnomind. I believe a group of neurologists developed it. You do a cheek swab, and you or your doc send it in for analysis. The test does NOT diagnose you for anything!! It gives your doctor a lot of information to consider about your specific brain chemistry, especially around what meds COULD work for you if you're diagnosed by a professional with something. So my doctor found that for me, Ritalin would not be ideal, which was also bore out by my personal experience with it for a bit. I take citalopram (antidepressant) and Lamictal. Lamictal is for a variety of uses. Like seizures and bipolar disorder. I don't live with that condition, but the results of my Genomind test suggested that a combination of meds like these two could help. The test didn't eliminate the need for time and discussion to see if they worked, but it reduced the amount of time wasted on meds that would have never worked for me. \n\n3. Hormones, Covid, etc. You and the other person posting about your slump/rut are young. I'm 47. Between my hormonal changes, coping with COVID as I started a new job, and my undiagnosed ADHD, and whatever else was probably going on, I couldn't will myself out of or adopt a new behavior to get me out of that place. I needed a therapist, medication, every tool I'd developed up to that point, friends and family, and a lot more. There are so many factors that contribute to how we think and feel. I've done cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for years. I transitioned to a psychiatrist to identify medications to get me out of my \"rut\" and talk through it all. As a friend, put it, \"You work so hard just to exist each day. You have so much going for you, and you are loved. If you're struggling to just keep your head above water, get the help you need so you're in touch with your joy again.\" I'm a Christian, and a very glass is half full person, so some of what she said was phrased to speak to my beliefs and outlook, but you get the picture. \n\nI'll hit my \"I'm not in a good place, and I need help\" 3-year anniversary this fall. By no means has it taken me 3 years to get to a better place. It was closer to several months, but who knows how long I was there for beforehand as I wasn't as self laware . I view where I was as a chemically, mentally, emotionally unbalanced place, so I relied on several tools to rebalancd me. I say this because I couldn't think or will my way out of how I felt. I needed all of those elements going for me to get to a mental space that was centered again, where I could consider my feelings and thoughts from a space of \"is this true or accurate, and even if it is, does it matter in the long run?\" Maybe I'm not explaining it well. Essentially, the life coping tools I had in my toolbox were no longer working because my head chemically wasn't in a good place. Once my doc and I got me to more even ground, I could rely on some time-tested tools and behaviors to feel like myself again. \n\nThe reason I'm sharing so much and I'm so adamant about meds, therapy, and using every tool at your disposal is I hate to think of you and others suffering like this for more than 1 month, let alone a year. You sound depressed, but I'm not a doctor.\n\nHaving to work my way out of a dark place during covid and starting a new job, I know things don't change overnight, but when my meds and other tools started helping me, my life changed for the better and it wasn't as hard to be the me I want to be. It got easier to start each day from a perspective of \"life is good\", or even on a bad day, \"I'm glad I'm here, let's do stuff that makes me feel good\" (exercise, showering, making new friends/connecting with existing ones, perting my cat, hobbies, tasks i enjoy at work, etc).\n\nSorry for the long post. Like I said, my heart ❤️ goes put to you, and having been in a bad place for a bit myself, I just want you to know that you're worth the time and effort to take steps to get a better place. But sometimes, all the stuff that used to work for us isn't enough. Don't give up, ok?? Start with 1-2 self care steps, like meeting more with your therapist and getting out into the sunlight each day (car ride, walk, etc). You've got this. Xxooo"

Random nutrients can be out of balance that absolutely ruin your energy and make ADHD much worse. Vitamin D, iron, and B12 are common ones, but it depends on your body and environment so a test could really help.

I'm not saying you don't have ADHD, but I have extensive experience with mental health and medication and I think you need to talk to your prescriber about this. \n\nAdderall helps my ADHD tremendously, but unless I also pay attention to my depression and anxiety, the ADHD meds just make me focus on it more. You don't necessarily need more meds, but you need to find a way to be more mindful. Meditation, exercise, therapy, etc. DM if you ever want to talk."

It’s not a dream job but it holds me accountable for doing something with my day. If you’re up for it, maybe find something to give structure to your day. It could be a job or volunteer work, or maybe a hobby or exercise club. I still have depression and I’m still in that same situationship, but it all feels bearable now. I’m not sleeping 13 hours a night anymore and I’m not crying every day. Last week I had one of the best days this year and all I did was go to the market for some cute fabrics and started on sewing a tanktop. But I was happy. I hope you’ll get out of this rut OP, you can do it :)"

    "comment": "In general, are you getting enough sleep?\n\nMy journey to an ADHD diagnosis started a while back ago - maybe like two years. \n\nFirst, I had issues with my feet (it's not exactly an ADHD thing) but that's where my medical journey started. I needed orthotics and special shoes for diabetics. Problem Fixed. \n\nA blood test showed that I have chronic low Vitamin D3 and a thyroid condition (low thyroid). I started medication and started to feel better. I had insomnia and so it got better with the thyroid medication. It took 6 months to feel better with that. With the low Vitamin D3 I get symptoms of feeling depressed, but I had nothing to be depressed about per say. I have a quiet life that is filled with school work and work in general. I live alone, but that's not a problem for me. Anyways, the Vitamin D3 supplements help me with that issue. \n\nThen I started to notice that I was falling asleep but I couldn't stay asleep. I was choking in my sleep. Another trip to the doctors that leaded me to a referral for a sleep study. That showed that I had sleep apnea. I stop breathing about 19 times per hour according to the sleep study I did. I was put on a CPAP machine and that solved that problem. I took to the machine well and was feeling way more energetic but I was still feeling foggy. My body felt good, my brain was still lost. \n\nI couldn't figure it out. Until one day I watched a video on YouTube of a guy showing what his side of the bathroom counter looked like. It was a mess. Turned out it he has ADHD. I looked around my room and it looked like a tornado had gone through it. It peaked my interest. I made an appointment with my doctor who referred me to a psychiatrist and was immediately put on Ritalin IR that same day. I went home, took 5 MG and cleaned my house. It was really cool honestly. I even stopped biting my nails. Sucks that it only works for 4 hours, but I just take a second dose whenever I need it. I can take up to 20 MG per day according to my bottle.\n\nI've been on Ritalin for about three months now. It's made a world of a difference for me, but it took a lot to get to this point. I'm in my mid thirties and learning to function now. It's bittersweet. \n\nI've been in school getting my associates for almost 8 years. Yes, it's a long time, but ADHD got in the way of it mostly. In the last 3 months I've completed 2.5 classes so I'm actually progressing and retaining everything. \n\nWhat keeps me organized is two things: A digital Task Manager (I use Tick Tick) and a scheduling app called Structured (iOS only). In Tick Tick I created folders for different aspects of my life. I have the following folders: Appointments, Bills, Reminders, Tasks/Recurring Tasks (these pop up on specific days/times), and each class has its own folder with assignments, exams, quizes, etc. \n\nIf you haven't had a physical yet this year, go in and get one. Have them run bloodwork to see if anything there can be addressed. Also, if you aren't feeling well rested when you wake up in the morning, consider getting a referral for a sleep study. Never hurts to see."

    "comment": "i would definitely talk to ur psychiatrist and discuss if it might be depressive symptoms that are arising , for me Ritalin never worked the only thing that helped me was Vyvanse, i also take lexapro for depression/anxiety. \n\ni still struggle to get out of bed but once i'm up i'm pretty good, for me the trick is to put some music on as soon as i'm awake and not overthink about the day that's ahead of me and force myself to get up right away (easier said than done i know). \n\ntry to get someone blood work done and check your thyroid and vitamin d cause that can cause what you're describing. I also supplement with Magnesium and Omega 3 which are very good for ADHD. i hope you feel better soon 🫶🏻"

I have started using this only very recently, but basically you tell it what you need to do and it does the cognitive functioning for you. It breaks down the task into as little steps as you want (for you- so you don't have to think of these little steps). It tells you how hard it's going to be, by spiciness and estimates how long it will probably take you. It even automatically helps you prioritize these tasks. \n\nNo shame, one of my todo's was to look underneath the bed... And it told me exactly how to carry out the action. I was personally so overwhelmed by the Schrödinger's cat that's under my bed that I hesitated looking there for days. Then once I put it through magic Todo, I just followed the instructions, instead of thinking about what I'm going to find underneath. And in the end what I found wasn't even that bad, just had a lot to bin. Anyway, don't feel ashamed if all you have to do is to go to the loo that day but you can't. This will give you basic instructions on how to get yourself out of bed, all you have to do is just follow along without thinking."

But daily dips, or three times a week, have made a gigantic difference. There’s some good research out there on this showing that it’s one of the best organic ways to get dopamine, and provides you with the longest lasting effect.\n\nIt’s cheap and easy to do. \nA. Have a bathtub. \nB. Get a bunch of cold packs that you keep in your freezer. \nC. See run your bath on cold with the ice packs in it and let it get cold. \nD. Get in, in one fell swoop.  \n\nPut on some good music, prepare for a little bit of pain and discomfort, but just recognize that you are not actually being hurt. It kinda suck to do, but after you’ll have higher Dopamine. You will feel refreshed, and continuing will give you a higher average level of consistent dopamine. \n\nI can’t tell you that I’m going through exactly what you are, but I’ve gone through some thing strikingly similar. And I think it’s because my dopamine levels were consistently too low. Duh. Obviously. So this is helping me keep my baseline dopamine levels slightly higher on average.\n\nAll the best.

Grains too might be causing an immune response because of leaky gut. Sugar/carbs in general spike insulin and destroy motivation.

All this carries into the night, disturbing your sleep, which leads to even more exhaustion, health problems and mental issues.\n\nYou could try Valerian, Tryptophan or 5-HTP for sleep aid. The things that really help are Excercise, Diet and Meditation. The Excercise will tune down the stress hormones, calm your nervous system, increase blood flow and in turn oxygen and nutrition levels etc. For the diet go low sugar, lots of green leafs and (plant based) protein. \n\nIf you want to go into supplements, Omega-3 and B12 are important for the ADHD Brain. Have your levels checked, and if you are low on B12, get some B12 Shots. They can be administered by yourself. That helped a lot with energy levels for me. A B12 deficiency often is the result of malabsorption in the stomach and gut lining, it doesn't matter if you are vegetarian/vegan.\n\nAnd believe me, I am painfully aware of being unable to maintain even a simple schedule. So I would go with the B12 shots, Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Valerian for sleep aid, as those require no effort and will probably help the most in relatively short time. Next thing is diet, followed by Meditation and finally excercise.\n\nAll the best! And trust me when I say you are not alone."

Somebody also suggested setting and alarm an hour before get-up-time jus to take meds and sleep another hour so they work already when you want to get up.\n- Have food that you’d love to eat all ready. No preparation needed, just a hardboiled egg, a muffin or meal replacement shake you bought yesterday or some overnight oats/sandwich if you feel like prepping the night before. Pro-Tip: i often forget what food I have, even if it is ready to be eaten. I write myself a post it and stick it on my headboard, if you forget what’s in your fridge, try it.\n- do intense cardio in the evening. Yes, sport may hype you up and cause you to fall asleep later, but I noticed that running 10k is so exhausting that i fall asleep quicker and sleep deeper.\n- change your bed sheets often: it’s awesome to fall asleep and wake up on fresh pillow cases. Idk why but pillow cases that have been used multiple days in a row are strangely more inviting to stay in bed for me.\n- this is no surprise: leave your phone/laptop in another room and push back using it until you ate breakfast, brushed your teeth and got dressed. Invest 5 - 10€ in an old school alarm or use a smart watch (don’t forget to charge and turn off silent mode, this has ruined multiple job interviews for me. If you need stimulation while getting ready try a book during breakfast, it feels nicer than doom-scrolling, gets your brain going and won’t cause you to fall asleep again like your phone might. You need to atleast somewhat sit-up to read or if you are lying it will fall on your face when you doze off.\n- i use sheer curtains, this way I wake up when the sun goes up. If that’s not an option, there are alarm clocks with sunrise lamps build in (check ebay)\n- most importantly, be compassionate with yourself. You struggling is not as much a sign of you failing as it is of you fighting. You writing this post, you feeling bad in the morning, about yourself, shows your commitment to change, even if you haven’t found out how to just now. We know the feeling, we believe in you, and don’t forget, your worth is intrinsic and not dependent on when you are getting up or how productive you are. You are loved and appreciated, in this instance by me for finding comfort in knowing that we are a community that fights together."

    "comment": "In case you are not doing that or did not try that: a strict sleeping schedule can do wonders.\n\nAt least that is my experience. If you can manage to go to sleep at roughly the same hour and sleep enough, but not too much, you might see the result in just 3-4 days. Maybe not, we are all different and what is considered a \"decent amount of sleep\" is also different between people.\n\nA few things that worked for me, just beware, YMMV:\n\n* When my sleep schedule is completely screwed, like one day I go to bed at 23, the next at 3, I start slowly. First day I just try to go to sleep before 2, next day before 1, next day gets it back to between 23 and 24. Does not work all the time, but it helps more often than not.\n* The hardest thing for me, but when I can do that, it always works: get out of any screen at least one hour before sleep time. Can't help with how to actually do that, though. I struggle with that all the time myself. Apps that change screen color help a bit, so maybe you can use that? I found that an app that turns my phone screen black and white is most useful. It irritates me so much that I get distracted from scrolling and reading memes. Usually, I just turn it off, but sometimes I actually manage to lay down the phone instead.\n* About sleep time. For me, the best feeling after the sleep I get after 8.5 hours. BUT. If I sleep 7.30-7.45 instead, I feel sleepy and a bit worse in the morning, but better afterwards. So, maybe you can try to sleep half an hour less than your normal time?\n* Important thing: the sleep schedule here is strictly about sleep itself. Not about getting out of the bed. Just try to wake up at a specific time, you can spend some time looking at your phone and laying down in bed afterwards. It will still help. At least it helps me, again, you might be different.\n* If you have trouble sleeping at night, as most of the people with ADHD do, seek help with that too. Sleep mask, ear plugs, cold shower before bed, more comfortable pillow, mattress, and blanket. Weighted blanket. Making the bedroom quieter – closing windows and doors. Adding more fresh air. Lullabies, some relaxing podcasts or audiobooks. Maybe some apps that supposed to get you to sleep. Maybe melatonin if it works for you and you can get it. Consult a doctor, if you can – check your nose in case you have some issues with breathing properly. Not everything will work for you, but turn your curiosity on and explore what will help you. Maybe you can meditate before the bed? Or do some spiritual rituals? I am not saying that magic or spirits or gods exist or not, just that if it works for you, then it works, no need to start bothering with details on how real it is and how much it is just your brain.\n* edit: another thought: you can try different alarms. Different things work better for different people. Personally, I like to use bird's chipping as an alarm sound, but some irritating electrical noises might work better for you. Then there are apps that supposed to track your sleep state and wake you up at the best possible time in a set time range. And you can try a light alarm if it is dark enough in the mornings where you live. No need for fancy Philips clocks or \"bright light\" lamps, even some Chinese lamp from AliExpress or something will tell you whether it works for you or not. Start small, you can always waste your money later."

I've been on and off stims for the better part of 15 years and I have noticed  that the stim meds actually made me feel that way. It was just like they dulled my excitement for life and made it so hard to get out of bed in the mornings. One thing I also noticed, in the last few years of being back on them, is that I don't hardly dream ever when on meds but I've been off for about a week and a half and my dreams are coming back and I don't feel like shit when I wake up at 330am for work.\n\nThis is completely anecdotal obviously but just a bit of info I've noticed."

    "comment": "Maybe talk to your psychiatrist about switching medication?\n\nMy experience has been that every medication loses effect over time, so maybe switching to something like Lisdexamphetamine (Elvanse/Vyvanse) could help?\n\nSomething else that you should probably do is throw Shorts, TikTok and Reels off your phone - they've been a major attention-grabber for me, and cutting them out has also helped me not lose hours of time there and feel like I've done nothing.\n\nAnd try to clean up your room. This may sound stupid, but in the simplest terms, you are an animal and its zookeeper. A tiger in a dirty enclosure without enrichment will never be as happy as a tiger in a clean enclosure with toys and other enrichment - so why should you not do the same?\n\nI know cleaning up is a daunting task. But, a good start for me was \"Don't put it down, put it away\" (e.g. after you have eaten something, you instantly clean the plate and silverware you used, and put them away. And, if something only takes about a minute to clean up, don't put that off but do it right now. It'll take you longer later on.\n\nAnd, one thing I also noticed (though this might be placebo): Take care of vitamins/proper nutrition and get some sunlight. Vitamin deficiency can be a bitch to deal with, so I just take some of those multivitamin tablets twice a week and I feel like it has helped me (and if it's only placebo, then at least it is a cheap placebo). And take walks, go for a run, whatever you can do on the outside.\n\nBut yeah, clean your living space, get some sun and exercise, and try to fill the time with something productive (maybe try to cook more yourself, if you're not doing that already?).\n\nAnd, ask friends for help. If you're too overwhelmed to clean yourself, asking a friend for help can also be helpful.\n\nAnd spend time with them. We are social creatures, and external events like meeting with friends can also help you put more structure into your day.\n\nBut, importantly: These are my experiences. I'm not saying that what I'm suggesting works for everyone, it was only what worked for me, and maybe someone else finds this helpful."

    "comment": "I had covid in December last year. It sucked bad for two weeks (bye Christmas!) and then 3 or so weeks recovering were kind of even worse. But then I was ok - or so I thought! I came to realise I had very mild long covid that continued for months upon months. The clue was my lungs just didn't feel quite as good as they did before covid. \n\nThe only thing that sorted this was a walking holiday in Devon. Devon has steeeep hills going down to the beaches. I forced myself to walk up those hills in order to really push my lungs. And that noticeably improved my lungs which improved a whole range of other symptoms like my mood. I'm now joining a cheap council gym that has a Technogym manual treadmill with a bean shaped tread loop that mimics those steeep hills in Devon. That should improve my lungs further. \n\nYour body needs oxygen for energy and alertness. The main way to improve that is by improving the lungs. \n\nSomething I also do is take methylene blue as that for a few hours improves oxygen carrying capacity of red blood cells and improves the effectiveness of mitochondria (what body cells use to actually create energy to drive every single process in the body). I use a liquid methylene blue solution (it's 97.56% water and 2.44% methylene blue which doesn't sound much but trust me it's enough) intended for tropical fish and bought off amazon. Fish are very very very sensitive to toxins so I feel confident it won't harm me. Its sold with a dropper. When taking it I first put the blue solution into empty but cap sealable size 000 gelatine capsule (capsules bought off amazon). I quickly swallow the capsule with water (blue solution will dissolve gelatine if left for a minute or so) and that stops the blue solution from giving me a blue tongue. It really helps. Methylene blue is used in hospitals (at far higher doses) so it's safe for most people. The only people who might want to be a bit cautious are those with health issues like high blood pressure or strong meds that could be confounding. But even for those it might be ok and could be well worth trying to improve health if desperate. Obviously if you try it, it's at your own risk and you should read up on it and you can discuss it with your doctors should you choose etc etc. There's plenty online about methylene blue as quite a lot of people interested in biohacking take it as an anti-aging treatment. \n\nI also take Ritalin Modified Release 3 times a day for a total of 40mg a day (15,15,10). I've taken it over this entire period and for me at least its not been any problem having methylene blue with it. I take a single capsule of methylene blue usually 2-3 times a day."

You're still in the running for all sorts of other diseases and disorders. Sinusitis is particularly insideous, because you think 'oh, my nose is a little blocked. big deal'. But it disrupts your sleep. Adhd already makes sleep hard, so anything else that interferes with sleep has a negative multiplier effect. And when you don't sleep, you feel like your wearing weighted clothing and everything is an effort. \n\nOne particular sign is you wake up super dehydrated, due to all the water lost mouth breathing. I drink a liter of water in the first 2 hours of waking, and that just gets me back to normal. But before that, I feel like it's all pointless, like I'm gathering up leaves only to spread them back on the grass the next day."

And if so, did they recommend anything regarding the depression or are you focusing on the adhd alone? I don't know your life or medical history, but I think it might help to look at expanding your treatment to approach this. That could be medication, or working on new coping techniques to address the difficulty adhd and depression add to your life. Both can make even the smallest tasks so so so fucking hard to do. However, treating the adhd alone might not change the way you feel-- breaking the cycle between the weight of depression and the trouble adhd makes for self management may make it easier to pull yourself out.

You'll think that the past was horrible, I'm in a horrible state, and the future will be horrible and wont change. While we can rationalize this as a \"realistic view\" it isn't until we talk to someone who can see the positives in our past (e.g. character development through our experiences), the positives in us (e.g. our strengths that we become blind to), and the positives of our future (should we pursue positive change).

I’m AuDHD and used to be misdiagnosed with depression in bouts when it was really just burnout. The difference is, and the reason I mention it based on what you shared, with burnout the answer is actually to do less and let yourself rest, possibly dive into special interests if that helps. The “recipes” for depression are different and personally they’ve sent me deeper into burnout at times because every ounce of trying was an ounce of energy I didn’t have and didn’t make it better. \n\nIf it’s depression, the best advice I would give is to find a place outside in nature everyday to either sit or walk if you can muster it. Breathe the fresh air, soak in vitamin D, watch the leaves move, listen to the sounds around you and smell the good smells. Walking in nature is even better because of bilateral stimulation combined with blood flow but if you’re exhausted, sitting in nature will be nourishing as well."

    "comment": "Ugh this is brutal! Kudos for recognizing that you aren’t feeling like yourself. I was recently at the same point, and it took a long time, but I found that what ultimately was the game changer for me was identifying the cause of this issue, because then I was able to figure out what to do/how to start trying to fix it. Just going to write out a couple of thoughts (in list format, only bc I feel like with my own adhd that makes info easier to digest):\n\n1. Is there any reason to think you might be burned out? What was your life situation when you first noticed this change start? For example, were you working, in school, etc.? If so, as insanely hard as it certainly would be, you might just need to let things fall apart and give your brain the break that maybe it needs. Do you have family or a support system who can help care for you right now? Even something as simple as having someone around to help with some of the daily chores of life can make a huge difference. \n\n2. Are you someone who gets a period? If so, do you have a gyn or endocrinologist who can check your hormone levels? Sometimes, hormone imbalances can make it so that our adhd symptoms are horribly exacerbated, and can even make it so that our meds don’t work the way they should/our body can’t use them the way they otherwise would. ADHD is a brutal disorder, and it wouldn’t be a surprise that if you’re not getting the relief you need from meds, things would start coming apart at the seams. \n\n3. Have you had Covid? If so, was it near in time to when this decrease in your energy levels/focus ability first started? \n\n4. How old are you? Have you talked to your doctor ab switching meds? I have a cousin who, in his mid-20s, his ADHD med literally just stopped working for him. He struggled for over a year and a half before finally going to his doc and switching to a different med. It made all the difference. \n\n5. Have you talked about the possibility that depression might be in the mix on top of your ADHD? I had a similar experience myself a few years ago. Temporarily adding a low dose SSRI literally saved my life (and career!), but if I hadn’t had someone suggest it to me I never would have thought to bring it up to my doctor."

But this last was over Christmas and I still feel like half my brain fell out. For months getting out of bed was impossible. I can’t remember things. I don’t have the super bad fatigue of some of my other long covid friends, but I know I’m not the same. There’s a cloud of horrid brain fog and that also means I can’t remember what I wanted to do. \n\nMy doc prescribed me anti-depressants as well as hooded my dose of Concerta. Sunshine and exercise have helped a ton. But now I’m stuck out of work cause of the SAG and WGA strikes and I feel like I’m backsliding. \n\nAnyway. \n\nTry to go for a walk every day in the morning. Or sit out side. Do something that gets you OUT. Don’t even listen to a podcast or bring your phone. Just grab your house key (important!) and walk once around the block. Or heck if that’s too much walk outside and sit on your front porch or stoop or a random bench/wall near the front door. Just look at the city and plants for a few minutes. \n\nThat won’t fix your problems. But it is a nice thing to do and it may help your brain get to a place where it can consider doing something more."

    "comment": "I take Ritalin as well, but like most ADHD medications, it’s not a cure-all. For this reason, I also take antidepressants in conjunction with work-life balance and mindfulness practices. Some things that help me:\n- Schedule work *and* personal activities \n- Focus on maintaining four areas of your life: \n  (1) what you do for money (e.g., job),\n  (2) what you do for professional development,\n  (3) what you personally enjoy (e.g., arts, socializing), and\n  (4) what you do for personal growth (e.g., new skills).\n- Keep a mindfulness journal \n- Stoicism philosophy \n\nI also recommend assessing your situation as there’s usually a hierarchy of priorities for motivation:\n1. Physiological needs\n2. Psychological needs\n3. Self-fulfillment needs\n\nWhich can be broken down further into Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs:\n1. Physiological \n2. Safety\n3. Love and Belonging\n4. Esteem\n5. Self-actualization\n\nI mention these because people tend to prioritize the wrong areas or feel like they should be somewhere in life that society or social circles expect you to be. For example, if you’re not financially secure (physiological and safety needs), how can you be expected to form quality relationships (psychological and love and belonging) or give back to the community (self-fulfillment)? As much as people preach that it is possible, it becomes a constant cycle of ups and downs that ultimately prevents the self from being at their best within each tier. \n\nHowever, everyone is unique and moves at different paces—that’s perfectly normal! Some people also have other external factors that help move them along. Although, for people who are fully independent and lack social circles of support, the areas mentioned above should be strongly considered. Otherwise, the inconsistencies that ADHD people often relate to deters us time and time again, which then builds up over time, leading to other mental health conditions and/or feeling unmotivated.\n\nI can go into detail, but I think that sums it up. I wish you luck and believe in you. You’re not alone!\n\nEDIT: Also going to add something called your locus of control. It’s your perceptions of the degree of control you have over your life. This area can be helpful with compartmentalizing where to focus your time and energy by breaking issues into three areas: what is out of your control (don’t worry about it), what you can influence (via your actions/activities), and what you have in complete control (mainly focus on these). Sometimes locus of control needs therapy or coaching to full understand this concept as an individual’s perception may not be reality."

I've taken up sport again regularly and assiduously, I'm passionate about it, motivated, no sleep problems. No side effects.\n\n\nThere is one big difference with Methylphenidate in my opinion:\nI have the impression that on Concerta and Ritalin, the effects are daily and almost instantaneous. There's also a big up/down effect.\n\nWhereas with Modafinil, in my case, it takes about 2 months to take full effect, and above all it's linear. No rise or fall.

Except your meds situation is like a parallel universe version of mine 💀 I've only been taking meds for 5 years, and instead of your combo I take adderall, zoloft, lamotrigine (Lamictal), and bupropion (Wellbutrin). So basically just replace the auDHD with some bipolar depression, hence the difference in the respective meds lmao\n\nLiterally 0 advice bc same, but I'm here if you wanna chat!!!

Try switching from Ritalin to something like Adderall or Vyvanse, I know many people who absolutely hate how Ritalin makes them feel and prefer Adderall or Vyvanse and on top of that I’m sure your body has become very accustomed to the Ritalin so the switch itself might be just what you need. Have your pill bottle next to your bed ready to go first thing you wake up. Second thing that I’ve learned works incredibly well for me (and I’m positive others have recommended it) is to get a workout in sometime in the later afternoon/evening before bed. Even if it’s just 20-30 minutes of lifting weights or medium intensity cardio, this will do wonders for your sleep. Good luck man, there’s an army of us out there going through the same issues."

It can be something as simple as just survive our drink a glass of water or get out of bed for 5 minutes.  Literally whatever you definitely feel capable of.  Even has breathing exercises to give you points, or even little stretches you can do (you'd be surprised how tense we are when we get stuck like this. Everyone I know is like geez you relax a lot and I have no words to tell them how stressful being stuck is.  It's not fun or remotely relaxing AT ALL. ) \n\nAnyway, with the points you can buy your baby bird little outfits, and it goes on little adventures and comes back to tell you about them which weirdly motivates me. The app really helps me when I'm at my lowest, but admittedly I forget about it for awhile when I feel a little better.  Finch. I think it's called finch."

I am on a combo of a strong SSRI and Wellbutrin (helps depression and adhd). You might just need a different combo of meds. I would find a new psychiatrist and see if they have any suggestions for a new treatment plan. Also I would try taking melatonin at night consistently. Take it at the same time every night. People with autism apparently underproduce melatonin so the rest we do get can often not be fulfilling leaving us feeling unrested the next day. Sleeping regularly at the same times everyday really helped my depression too."

I could set-up a WhatsApp group that people could join. Everyone would make a list of two to three things that they need to do each day. It could be as simple as get out of bed before noon, brush my teeth once and eat at least two meals.\n\nFor everyday that you do this, you could send a message to the chat saying ‘i WON today’ or something and then you’d receive a point. We could then have a leaderboard, and figure out some sort of fortnightly prize for the winner? I think the dopamine kick of getting a point, seeing yourself on a leaderboard and having an online support group would really help (it’d help me at least). \n\n I’d also be keen to participate but I’d be happy to administrate the chat. \n\nMaybe reply to this comment if you’d be interested and if we get enough traction, say 10+ people - I’ll make a group chat :)"

Can you think of other symptoms that have randomly come and gone, or have been constant (like air hunger/right chest etc)—anything?\n\nThere’s a big possibility that covid lowered your body’s immune system so that latent viruses that were already present in the body (but kept in check by your immune system) can go into a “chronic state”, and cause a number of symptoms. There’s a list that is easily google-able that can list all of the potential viruses and their symptoms, but some of the most common include Epstein-Barr (doesn’t matter if you already had mono—same goes for strep!), Streptococcus [Aureus](? I think? Basically, strep), HHV-6, and more. \n\nFor anyone who started having multiple seemingly unrelated symptoms—with both your physical and mental health—I HIGHLY recommend finding a LYME LITERATE doctor near you (your GP won’t test correctly, if at all)…because it could very easily also be late stage Lyme disease. My symptoms started after I got mono, and Covid apparently does something really screwy to the immune system (I feel like the only person who hasn’t had it since I was a legitimate hermit the entire time….I couldn’t really take a chance with where my health was at that time but I sleep most of the time anyways haha).\n\nPlease feel free to ask any questions! There’s a HUGE lack of awareness when it comes to Lyme disease and how common it is (most people—including myself—don’t remember ever being bitten by a tick in the first place). The years I spent feeling like I was worthless/ crazy/ dying (all were separate phases, while I was seeing different straight up western medical doctors—one after another after another; not getting answers despite everything being so off).\n\nI will shout about it from the freaking rooftops if I can help one person shorten the span between when they get really sick and when they’re able to see an LLMD, have answers, and start treatment! I don’t want anyone to get to the point where you’re going to sleep having to make peace with the idea that you *might not wake up* because it feels like none of the systems in your body are functioning properly. It’s a sad and pretty helpless feeling, but took about 3.5-4 years to get to that point. \n\nLyme is literally an epidemic, and doctors are so weird about it because they’re taught VERY LITTLE about it in medical school, so they tend to always just dismiss it. It’s a huge problem. I mean, you think of all the celebrities that have been through their own years of struggling with Lyme disease (that’s just the ones who opened up about it, and I think there are at least 10)…it’s a significant amount of people considering there aren’t THAT many famous people who’s names are recognizable to almost everyone.\n\nBest to all!!!!"

Yeah, I struggled at work but was never in danger of getting fired and would get stuff done around the house.\n\nI got COVID in January 2021 while I was doing a masters program. It was super mild and lasted less than a week, but it was a struggle to get through that spring semester. Then, over the summer, I was unable to line up a job or internship. For about 4 months I basically laid on my couch with no energy to do anything. Even playing video games felt like it consumed too much energy, so I'd just lie there watching TV or YouTube and eat junk food. Went from 220 and pretty muscular to 260 pounds and looking awful. My poor wife was so frustrated, and I think we both just chalked it up to me being a lazy piece of shit. But now, after getting through it a bit and with the help of medications, it's amazing to actually have energy again and not dread doing little things like doing the dishes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP:  Sorry you're going through this OP. I agree with the commenter above to maybe look into this even if you never tested positive. Also, if you can get an appointment with a physician for a physical with bloodwork -- I know it might be difficult depending on your insurance status -- it would be good to make sure there aren't any other hormonal or other physical issues. I'm just throwing things out, but any chance you have sleep apnea or another kind of sleep disorder?\n\nIf you can, I'd explore those things if you haven't already. Also, it might be time to ask for a change in your medication if they think it's appropriate. It doesn't seem like the methylphenidate is doing much for you anymore. Supplementing with D3 (especially if you aren't getting outside much) and omega-3 also probably wouldn't hurt, but the effectiveness of these may be minimal.\n\nSorry, I've thrown a lot at you, and there are a lot of responses. I won't say I know what you're going through because a year is a long time to feel so shitty, but I feel like I've at least had a taste of that experience, and it is a horrible existence. I'm not a doctor, but I am a nurse, so I like to think that I know a thing or two about health. If you have any questions, please let me know! We're all pulling for you!!"

I kinda stops the ability to get up and just sit there until meds kick in or the desire to get ready for work. I don’t have to wait. I’m sorry that you are in the funk you are in. It’s taken me a while to figure out just how structured I need to be. My kids are grown and out of the house, but while they were growing up I was on top of shit. Super clean house, never missed an appointment, never late for work, and cared about my physical appearance. Not any more. My house is a wreck and I have 4 huge dogs with zero give-a-shit to fix the situation. I’m on Cymbalta, Wellbutrin, and Vyvanse. To add insult to injury currently going through menopause. I’m just ready to be “normal” and productive again. Here’s to hoping you get it figured out too. 💜"

I turn in at around 7AM and sleep until 4PM and I always seem to land back on this sleep schedule no matter how many times I've tried to fix it.\n\nI have to set an alarm though because otherwise I may oversleep and I've found that if I get too many hours of sleep, I feel even worse.\n\nI've had my bloodwork done fairly recently (within the past six months) which only showed that I could use a little more potassium, so no underlying issues there, thank gosh, and I've never had trouble staying asleep. I visit my doctor every six months since ritalin is a controlled substance, but I'm due for my physical in about a month. It might not hurt to ask if I can go on in sooner.\n\nI do have a severe lack of non-medicinal support, however. I was started on ritalin almost a decade ago and I was never given any other resources to help with my ADHD and I have to say, I'm a little bummed out about that :'D\n\nI'm going to look into the apps you recommended here because I could really use that kind of structure in my life in order to get through episodes like these."

Not a great habit, I know.\n\nAs for how I spend my day, I find myself caught on my phone a lot, but I've been working on putting that down and it's been going okay. I usually get up and shower and try to do some chores, but I get distracted fairly easily and getting started is like moving a mountain.\n\nI could have better boundaries with my phone though, so I'm going to talk to my therapist about that and about putting it down—it's my only point of contact with the outside world right now though, so I don't know how I'll follow through, but if it means getting out of this, I'll find away gosh darnit."

    "comment": "OP, I'm replying to this comment in the hopes that it increases your chances of seeing it.\n\nThere's a observed neurochemical effect that's not well understood called the dopamine-serotonin seesaw. What this means is that when you raise someones dopamine levels (the neurotransmitter responsible for focusing, though this is a massive over-simplification) it can cause a corresponding drop in serotonin (the \"feel good/happy\" nuerotransmitter).\n\nPeople with ADHD are much more likely to have depression as well, and if someone with both ADHD and depression is only having their ADHD treated the effect of the dopamine-serotonin seesaw can be that their depression significantly worsens. This is a potential \"side effect\" of ADHD medication that frankly people don't hear enough about.\n\nI urge you to take these concerns to your doctor. They can evaluate you for depression and potentially give you a SSRI or similar to help treat your lowered serotonin levels. I'm sure the right combination of meds exists that can help bring both your dopamine and serotonin levels back up to normal so that you don't feel so overwhelmed.\n\nEdit: I just realized that I didn't make this clear. ADHD stimulant medication like Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse etc all generally work by increasing the amount of dopamine in your brain, this increase is what allows ADHD folk to function effectively. This increase in dopamine levels is what can potentially lead to the dopamine-serotonic seesaw effect."

You just have to get to X number eventually. \n\nSomehow, not being forced to do exercises in a burst all at once makes it much easier and more fun for me to get to a certain number of repetitions than if I were to pace myself. It's challenging enough to get a good workout in, but easy and mindless enough that I can do it on a daily basis. \n\nIt takes away the mental struggle of bargaining with myself to do more repetitions, because I don't get a say in how many I have to complete."

So your friends can enjoy and want to re-do it. At some point they will ask you, how they can help you in the process and invite you back.\n\nIf you fear that you won't be able to finish cleaning your house you have to plan enough hours/days to clean it in advance. Also have an emergency plan: throw everything that is lying around in a bag and store it away. Throw everything in one room and lock it. Deal with organising that mess later. Focus on cleaning the apartment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI tell you two stories:\n\n1) There was a friend I barely knew when he found an apartment in my street. I visited him for coffee and sometimes it got late so we had a quick snack at his place or ordered a pizza. I always hated to come home from work and being alone so I made it a habit to stop by at his place in the evening. Sometimes I had dinner at my place, sometimes he made himself a quick dinner (sausages and fries, nothing fancy) and asked if I wanted something as well. At some point we just established to cook something together. Sometimes I brought groceries and cook for him, sometimes we went to buy groceries together and cooked together.\n\n2) I have this friend group that just meets to get drunk. I was getting bored by this. So I started to invite friends to have lunch together (I bought and cooked everything). I also initiated to have a sushi party with my sister and three male friends. A friend and I prepared 75 makis for them. We ate and had some drinks. Then the other friends wanted eagerly to make makis as well and so we made 75 more makis together. A couple of months later one of the friends was then hosting a sushi party at his place and the others were excited for revival. \n\nMy conclusion: People are excited to try out new things. And I am certain that your male friends might have the same fears like you. But sometimes one has to make the first step towards others. In my opinion, everybody has to have dinner and everybody hates to have dinner alone - so it is a good reason to get together."

Keep that in mind maybe if you notice the same thing. \n\nIf intense excercise is not an option, the cat sounds like a nice idea, you'll have to try that out and see if playing with it makes you feel more awake or more sleepy afterwards. If it makes you more awake, maybe not a good idea before bed, but ideal in the morning. In the evening you could also take a stroll around the block if that is possible in your area, petting the neighbourhood cats, listening to a podcast, but limiting screen exposure (I sound like my parents, but they were on to something).\n\nWith the chores, I often do the same with podcasts, it works great when motivation is low.

I fell into the trap of thinking that the medication was something I'd have to take for the rest of my days but it's to give you the help needed to get into better circumstances to where you don't need the medication anymore. So try and pinpoint any blindspots you have (with your therapist) that may be causing your depression whether it's current circumstances or negative beliefs that you hold about yourself. We all have blindspots in our lives and sometimes it takes someone else's perspective to show us shows something we didn't see before. Also try to form a social circle if you don't have one as it helps a lot. I hope all goes well with the doctor and therapist! And just remember, it's going to get better. This rough phase will pass"

    "comment": "Yikes I was medicated for ADHD super late and already took sertraline for anxiety but the sluggish feeling when unmedicated can really mimic depression. I have had depression once in my life (when my I broke-up with my first boyfriend over 10 years ago - lame lol) and it’s definitely not the same thing. However, going unmedicated can make me seem depressed to other and their constant asking while I need so much sleep or an always tired made me feel awful…. I was tired and something was off but I was not depressed.\n\n****It’s important to know the difference as the opposite can also happen: too much serotonin can lower dopamine. Of course because of the apparent high functioning level of my ADHD first like was to raise Zoloft even though I kept saying something else was off, I did not feel sad just chronically exhausted. Still doctors were pretty good at trying different things - first was adding in Wellbutrin. I swear I was maxed out on Wellbutrin and felt ZERO difference. The day I tried Vyvanse 30 mg… man, I felt robbed of 30 years of the full potential me.\n\nI went on a 5 day Vyvanse break this week and for the first 2 days it was fine - I just felt like I could Netflix and chill (sleep) but after day 3 I was definitely getting in a rut and getting nothing done (even though I knew I could be kind of off those days) but by day 5 I was like, ok this is enough, I went undiagnosed for 30 years - I don’t want to feel like this and ADHD is 100% my primary mental health issue - my anxiety just gets worse because by day 3-4 I’m behind in everything (specially being so self critical) that it’s… give me all the jitters ADHD med! The side effects are so very little compared to the benefits for me.\n\nMy history of mental health: despite some pretty serious mental health issues caused by birth trauma (3 lost full term babies before me) from my mother, I grew up with nothing too noticeable. I was, by all means, thriving at school and in my social life, specially given my mother’s issues - as my father/family would always appear really proud of how I was coping… I had a lot of “village” help when my mom was just, in her trauma world (don’t judge her at all today). \n\nAt 17, my mom got better, I tried weed with friends (my mom resorted to substance abuse which became such a fear for me) and of course, had a full blown panic attack just by smelling weed - I had like one puff. It was awful. I thought I was for sure dying and the feeling scarred me and definitely led to a legitimate panic disorder.\n\nI had the panic managed by early 20’s though but as a coincidence, I stopped being a competitive athlete at post college too and that really helped and helps my ADHD (sports). I was stuck in a cycle where I felt we’ll - panic free - but not well enough as an Ivy League/corporate America woman. I stayed in this GAD label for over 10 years. Weekly therapy, doing everything right but the exhaustion… why? Then after my first daughter was born I just started sobbing to my therapist that my 2 extra hours had to be for my daughter and I just wanted to sleep and was exhausted and no it was not laziness or depression.\n\nAnyways, all this to say, sertraline alone can also worsen ADHD as it lowers dopamine so I can definitely see the same being the case in the other scenario. \n\nThe persisting ADHD has definitely put me in a constant anxious state that I never felt like I could stop the Zoloft but this post is super helpful to understand why I still need it and shouldn’t mess with my regimen. I’ve been feeling like since my ADHD was addressed, I might not need the anti-depressant and could get by with benzos (I’ve taken them without abusing for over 10 years and they would just be a security blanked to when I feel on the verge of panic). Your post made me never consider that. Instead, I’ve been talking to my therapist and psychiatrist (proactive about mental health, love therapy lol) and they’ve both been pushing to just switch the Zoloft to a newer drug to just test if it works better to keep me less anxious - I still have a slightly above average anxiety level… they said I could always go back to sertraline/Zoloft so I might do it. Zoloft is great for anxiety but there are new SSRI’s that are even more targeted towards anxiety as opposed to depression (Lexapro being an example but there are even newer ones). \n\nThey still feel like since I don’t have depressive features at all and sertraline is a very old school SSRI, I could get to a place of needing even less ADHD meds/rescue benzo if I have a more modern anti—anxiety med in my system accumulating so much dopamine stealing serotonin… it’s a complicated balance. \n\nI probably will try and if it goes bad go back to Zoloft but I hate changing meds (my mom was always changing meds and nothing was ever enough for her so I’m probably just trying to be different than she was - inner child wound vibes). Your post made me realize there is a real dual connection between dopamine and serotonin and that I should NEVER stop an SSRI (never say never but you know what I mean) but instead could try the newer versions that could put me naturally in a more serotonin-dopamine neutral level.\n\nI have zero problemas in taking my SSRI + Vyvanse forever but as a perfectionist, having the least amount of meds and optimizing my treatment is always a goal of mine - just like with physical health. Let’s see. Sorry you got the hyperfocus - ADHD med hasn’t kicked in yet version of me! lol"

I hadn't taken citalopram (lexapro) since my mid-20s because it caused pretty constant orthostatic hypotension which wasn't ideal as a busy young mom. Now that I'm physically disabled and my kids are adults, I can take my time and it isn't a problem, so when I realised my depression had been pretty constant for the past 6 months, I requested switching. I tapered off sertraline and onto citalopram over a month and I feel better than I have in years! I also take 70mg of elvanse (Vyvanse) a day."

When your mind tries to guilt trip you or otherwise negative thoughts, mentally (or literally) scream at it, \"I can't\" (short for I can't help it), \"It's ok\" (to not do it), or \"I'm tired\".\n\nMake your conscious view towards yourself someone that you would be taking care of that is ill. Thinking that you should be able to do [insert x], which is creating the guilt you feel is a learned behavior in your brain from what you have experienced through life. However that doesn't make it true, and often times, it forms a strange kind of arrogance. The first step is realizing that normal people don't treat themselves like that, and lower your own expectations of yourself accordingly. Eventually after you reset your expectations, you can feel proud (i.e. get those dank neurotransmitters) for doing tasks you set for yourself, and snowball from there.\n\nOtherwise, my trick for getting up in the morning on those hard days was to set a random time threshold (no funky numbers do like half pasts/even oclocks or quarters at worst), and then when you reach that time threshold immediately tense all the muscles in your body and do a silent scream (to tense your facial muscles, but make noise if you need to) and immediately after use your arm muscles to push yourself out of bed (don't think about it, or what you are getting out of bed for, just do it). Can put on some vibing music or something to help that sequence if that helps."

ADHD isn't bad, it wants you to be happy and safe, if you don't feel happy and safe in your day to day life it thinks you're doing something unsafe and makes you stressed. Just remove the room for it to guess, make your mind up about being a good person and wanting to have a productive day, if there's no room to doubt then there's no reason for it to get you stressed and triggered about waking up :3"

The hard part while doing these things is to mentally separate putting restrictions on yourself, from enabling your own mental criticism. Need to simultaneously give yourself rules while lowering your expectations so that you don't expect yourself to get something done reliably without those rules.\n\nIt's like seeing a super in shape person carry a heavy backpack while hiking fast. You wouldn't expect someone not in shape to carry as heavy as a backpack, nor to hike very fast with it on. Another example is someone who is very short playing basketball, compared to a taller person. The mind needs to accept that all the years of people telling it, that it should be able to do \\[insert task\\], that those people were lying/uneducated. Need to learn to be accept what you can do currently as the new benchmark, and that is ok."

Meditation is great for this too, but I absolutely physically could not do it until I'd done yoga for a while. Now I do both most days.\n\n3) You can do it from home or in a studio. I mainly do it from home using an online subscription because being stuck to a STRICT schedule and having to leave the house are difficult for me. You can also do anything from 15-90 mins. Getting started is often the hardest part for me, so a low commitment short vid can help get me going.\n\n4) It's entertaining.

I don't like to scare people but I do like to be honest with experiences so if other people have the same experiences they'll know they aren't crazy. \n\nThat said if you think you're inclined towards self fulfilling prophecies, jog on and read something more positive, because this was a particularly negative experience. \n\nAt first it was okay. At first I had some motivation. Like the house was a little cleaner.. I was calmer. It definitely suppresses appetite, I lost a few kilos over a month because food was of zero interest to me. I had to put on timers to eat just to prompt myself because I had so little desire to eat. It also raised my heartbeat per hour almost instantly on average by 12 beats per hour, even on a low dose. I have a low resting heart rate so it was within tolerance, but something to be conscious of if you do have concerns. \n\nI did however realise that the calmer turned into blunting and I was suddenly casually suicidal. \"oh, maybe I should just kill myself\" occurred to me as just a thing I could do. And nothing gave me feelings. Everyone could have dropped dead and I would have felt nothing.\n\nI also found  ALL creative ability went away.  I went from writing 3000 words a day to zero. My head was silent. Dead silent. I had not a single thought at any time. As time went on and it built up in my system, I started to forget whole words. I started to mix up phrases I'd known for years, like \"Silver lining\" became \"Golden lining\". I couldn't remember how to spell words..  I'm a paid writer, so this was less than ideal. \n\nI also forgot my kid's middle name. I mean it when I say it decimated my memory. Like..in a scary 'do I have dementia' kind of way. \n\nI noticed really dark urine, started to get kidney pain. Found out this could be a side effect in some people. Around this time I started to get exceptionally drowsy all day long. I'd sleep for 9-10 hours and still not be able to function. All I could do was sit and stare.\n\nI also got moodier. I couldn't feel sadness or happiness but I could feel anger. I was constantly irritated. \n\nIn the end I just couldn't draw a single positive from it. It sounds like some people do really well on it, but for me it really did not bring anything positive to the table. It's been a week since I've stopped taking it and I'm only starting to get coherent thoughts back. I couldn't make sentences verbally. Even my husband noticed and said he was concerned and wanted me to get off it. He's never had an opinion on medications I've been on before, but he was actually worried about me on this one. \n\nI truly hope it works out better for you, sounds like it's a miracle drug for some people, for me I might as well have thrown my brain in a dumpster."

    "comment": "I tried Strattera (atomoxetine), that one wasn't for me. Multiple side effects did not resolve after 8 weeks, and I wasn't deriving much noticeable benefit. It kind of muted things and made me feel rather lethargic throughout most of the day, kind of out of it and not really myself (I'm not sure what brain fog is so maybe it was that?). Even when taking it with a full meal in the morning, proteins and fats and carbs and all, I would predictably get overwhelming nausea about 90 minutes after taking it, and that would last half an hour to an hour. Dramamine and ginger candies helped get me through it but the nausea was the biggest factor in discontinuing. It was a weird nausea, I never actually threw up or really felt like I would. I just felt like death. Couldn't deal with that in the middle of my work day. It also tanked my appetite, I struggled to eat a reasonable amount and lost 6% of my body weight in those 8 weeks. Then in the late afternoon/evening, overwhelming drowsiness. If I could get past that, I'd feel like myself again for a couple hours before bed. I also had very bad dry mouth that never improved, moderate constipation, and some sleep issues. I could fall asleep fine but I would wake up randomly around 4am unable to get back to sleep for 1.5-2 hours. (Normal wake up time is in the 6am-7am area.) That didn't happen every night, but it was often enough to suck. All of this stuff went away when I stopped atomoxetine. \n\nI have been on Intuniv (guanfacine ER) for about 5 weeks now and that is absolutely helping my emotional regulation. Mild side effects, so far manageable. Emotional dysregulation is one of my biggest struggles so I'm really happy this is helping. My mouth has been a bit drier but it's not severe, I'm not worried for my dental health. I feel I am more prone to headaches, although honestly that likely has more to do with seasonal allergies. Mild constipation, I've been taking a fiber supplement and that's working great (but don't take it at the same time as other meds bc it can inhibit absorption). But I am able to stop and think more than I could before. That little bit of extra time and space to process has helped me handle impulsive responses, like snapping at my partner, or getting tilted about surprises or unexpected changes in plans (I'm also autistic), or taking things personally.\n\nI am also on Wellbutrin (bupropion) and that's the only other psych medication I have."

I was instructed to take it at bedtime but asked if I could take it in the morning because I am not reliable with consistently taking meds at night. I was told I could so long as it doesn’t make me drowsy or fatigued. Guanfacine ER helps with my emotional dysregulation/rejection sensitivity which is what I was hoping for when trying it. It unexpectedly helps significantly with insomnia.  \n  \nI wouldn’t say the drug isn’t worth bothering to try, but as a general rule I don’t make drug recommendations."

I believe it answers the questions you asked as well :) \n\nI’ve been taking this med, 1mg, every night for the past four days, and let me tell you, it has been a complete game changer for me! It’s amazing how quickly I’ve seen results—sometimes I have to check in with myself to make sure I’m not just imagining the changes 🤣. The difference has been incredible! I have had 0 side effects at all, no drowsiness, no sexual side effect, no blood pressure issues. I guess in that sense, I’m lucky, as I’ve seen quite a few people who have had not so great side effects.\n\nOver the weekend, I accomplished so much more than I ever thought possible. I actually did things like used a dish and put it right in the dishwasher, or washed it—what a concept! I got out of bed, made it, brushed my teeth without a second thought, and even tossed my clothes directly into the hamper instead of letting them pile on the floor. I found myself tidying up everywhere I went, and I even washed my car!\n\nIt might sound a little over the top, but I promise, I’m not a messy person; it’s just that I’ve always struggled to push myself to tackle tasks I didn’t enjoy. This medication has really flipped a switch in my brain, and now those thoughts don’t even cross my mind anymore. It’s not like oh I’m excited to pick up after myself or excited to wash the car, shit even leaving the house for mundane tasks became an extreme effort. Instead of being excited, or putting things off, I just….did them. I knew I wanted to wash clothes, or didn’t want dishes in the sink, so I just did it.\n\nHonestly, I never expected this kind of impact from the medication, and I wish I’d discovered it 20 years ago! The only other medication I take is Adderall 15mg, which I’ve used since childhood, but this new one has blown it out of the water when it comes to helping with executive dysfunction. I can’t wait to see how this week at work goes!"

The fog is definitely gone at this point. Instead of perhaps 4-6 fleeting thoughts or movements at a time, it’s gone down to 1-2 fleeting thoughts and movements. I don’t think it will fully go away, which is fine. I like that part of my personality. \n\nI’m not stoic, nor robotic. I’m still myself, bubbly personality & slightly squirrely. I can think clearly enough to notice what’s occurring with physical and mental symptoms of anxiety to help problem solve. The overwhelming ADHD overstimulation has reduced, it takes a lot to overwhelm me. (If my needs are met, no vulnerability) I still will not feel well if I haven’t gotten a good nights sleep or eaten. \n\nIt’s something I would recommend. It may be a combination of all of the medication, such as Wellbutrin. I may bump to 4mg if I find work focus getting difficult. It’s typically taken at night, and will knock you to sleep within a half hour. Which is great, helps with evening anxiety."

I don't exactly know what I'm worried about but it's nice to know that there are options other than increasing doses for stimulants, which I'm not sure I want to do.\n\n  \nThe overwhelm and overstimulation issues are quite big for me still. And that sounds lovely about it helping a touch with fleeting thoughts. I've heard so many good things about Wellbutrin that it's ridiculous I'm still nervous about trying, and this is a blood pressure medication but my blood pressure is within normal range according to my GP. Still kind of makes me want to try both eventually - one at a time to see what the effects are of either. Anyway!

It can lower your blood pressure, and for me that made me EXTREMELY tired and dropped my BP into the 40s at some points. Its impulse control methodology basically makes your reward pathways less responsive, and for me that made me extremely unmotivated and depressed in a way I had never felt before. I took guanfacine for two months & am diagnosed with ADHD and PTSD for reference. I thought maybe these side effects would go away with time, so I took all the pills prescribed to me. As soon as I got off them I started to feel better and got back on Adderall. \nThere are some people on Reddit with positive experiences, including people who couple guanfacine with stimulants! :] I hope it is a better experience for you, and if not then I hope hearing my experience makes you feel less alone.

I would then take 1mg 1 hour before bed.   \n\n\nAt time time I was trying many anti depressants as my depression was worsening, and I wanted a low does during the day because I didn't want any of those 2-4% side effects I had read about.   \n\n\nHowever within a month even at that low dose, I think it really helped, sadly I had to stop taking it because of some interactions with an antidepressant I tried, and I just now am attempting to resume use.   \nI had no luck with antidepressants, but eventually tried ECT, and it was vey successful, so the first thing I am going to try is ER at night with my current ADHD medicine (Lisdexamfetamine)  \n\n\nI will also be trying my IR routine, with 3 a day dextroamphetamine to see how it works after ECT, as before I think depression really stiffened of the benefits that Guanfacine gave to aid in the fight against ADHD.   \n\n\nI will update what I find out, but I can say, I would of absolutely lost my job at once point if not for the combination, I ultimately lost my job on a \"leave to deal with insomnia from the worsening depression\" because I didnt check my snail mail. (Walmart.. yeah Ill rat them out)  \n\n\nHowever, that was a blessing in disguise, because while it took nearly a year, I do not believe I would of been able to afford ECT without state funded healthcare. I am very optimistic about my future now, including the potential benefits of Guanfacine now that it doesn't have to fight the anxiety and nervous ticks of my depression.  \n\n\nTLDR, Guanfacine is worth trying, even if it doesn't work for you, just titrate off of it slowly as it has some pretty crazy side effects even if you don't think it's working, oh look something shiny."

It wasn't quite as bad as what you're experiencing though.\n\nI'd say watch your heart rate if you can and try to drink a lot of water and caffeine to help while your body adjusts. I also found that b12 supliments helped.\n\nI'm breaking out now but it's more along with my cycle as usual and I don't know that these meds affected that.\n\nIt did take about 3 weeks for the tiredness to go away.\n\nThis drug does wonders for emotial regulation more than anything else, I've not gotten into a depressive state since I started taking it which is something that happened often before. I also feel like I'm less under water with this. It doesn't really help with motivation but it does help me not get distracted by nagging thoughts and feelings.\n\nIf you can push through the tiredness I think the end result is pretty good.\n\nI've had two instances of emotional upheaval in the past week that normally would have sent me to a very dark place but on this drug I'm able to acknowledge that bad things happened and deal with it rather than crying in my room for a week with a tub of ice cream."

In the beginning it seemed to help a little with something, though I am not really sure what - hard to put my finger on it. But the weirdest part was, guanfacine worsened my already poor sleep. Even if I took it in the morning. Everyone is different, so listen to your body! I didn't feel 'good' in the gym again until I really got <2mg. I had no idea it was affecting me that much.

    "comment": "I saw a post from you from a few months ago where you gave quite a praise to guanfacine. I'm really curious if you think that was placebo, or if the effects were truly there but waned (extra curious about the perfect pitch). Could it be that you titrated too quickly? It seems that there is little agreement among doctors as to what the dosages and titration schedules should be (a natural consequence of the lack of FDA approval for adults, I guess). I'm wondering if it takes longer to build cumulative effects than people realize and titrating too quickly results in good effects at first, but then the dose becomes overwhelming.\n\nI'm on 3mg myself at the moment, titrated from 1 and 2 over the course of 3 weeks. Had a very good effect at 1mg that disappeared, but I think it's coming back at higher doses (I'm now second-guessing whether I'm just starting to feel the cumulative effect). For now, it actually seems to help with the gym, I set a couple of PRs on it already and feel more energized. Did you feel that way at the beginning at all?"

My heart rate still drops pretty low at times (low 40's) but I guess my body is getting used to it because it doesn't make me as sleepy as it did before.\n\nI do take some b12 and drink tea but I have a history of deficiency with b12 and I don't drink tea excessively. I'm really not great at drinking enough water and I really need to work on it.\n\nAs for positives it's taken my doom spirals away, I had an upset two nights ago. Something like that in the past would have put me in a very dark space for at least a few days but I was able to pull myself together and leave it behind. It feels weird in a way like it wasn't hard to move past it at all so it almost doesn't feel like a triumph even though it really really is, it just felt, natural.\n\nI don't have as much task avoidance but I still do struggle with it. I'm going to see about starting on Concerta again to add a stimulant to it, Concerta had made me depressed within 3 days of starting it and even though I could get stuff done it wasn't worth it. I'm thinking if the intuniv helps with the doom spirals so much it might counteract the depression the Concerta sets in.\n\nThe thing I was most worried about was lessening of feelings/emotions because people talk about that a lot. I think it's misleading, because I still have all of my feelings but they are no longer distracting me. I don't get sad or annoyed or excited or turned on so much that I can't focus on anything else. Those feelings are still there it's just that I can control them rather than letting them control me.\n\nI see my doctor next week so I'll talk with her about the Concerta and my heart rate but it's going pretty well. It's not a miracle drug but it does help."

As such, guanfacine doesn't have any stimulative effect, so everything related to feeling more energetic or attentive is likely due to the fact that guanfacine allows you your much needed rest.\n\nBest of luck!"

The negative consequences of untreated ADHD are increased risk of cigarette smoking, substance abuse, alcohol abuse, pregnancy, divorce, underachievement academically, criminal activity, impulsive risky behavior.\"\n\nAnd,\n\n\"The general public doesn’t recognize the threshold beyond which the severity merits a psychiatric diagnosis.\"\n\nAs well as\n\n\"Investigations have found that some telemedicine companies prescribe Adderall and other controlled substances pretty indiscriminately. Do you view overprescription as a widespread problem?\n﻿I think the widespread problem is the lack of education.\"\n\nDEA, please don't exhibit an attention deficit on this next part:\n\n\"And presumably a lot of people getting these prescriptions via telehealth do actually need them.\n﻿I’ll just give you some numbers. The prevalence rate for ADHD in the U.S. for adults ages 18 to 44 is 4.4 percent. Of that 4.4 percent, 75 percent were never diagnosed as children, and only about 25 percent of those who presume to have ADHD are being treated. So you have a tremendously underserved population of people who have this disorder....\n\nBe careful of interpreting increased prescriptions of medications as a bad thing. It may simply be that people with the disorder are now coming forward and getting treatment.\"\n\nI can't quote much more and still give full justice to the insight, scope, scolding and yet also compassion of the article.\n\nSo I'll just leave it with this final quote:\n\n\"If we had a shortage of insulin like this, how fast do you think Congress and legislators would tolerate this for the general public?\""

Usually when I have to stop taking them it’s because a dr is taking their time with the script, the store is out for a day, a prior authorization is needed etc. this feels different. I called 30 stores today and finally found one that had my prescription. Unfortunately the people that work at the drs office aren’t very sympathetic and don’t prioritize the adhd scripts. After 5 hours of waiting they sent over the prescription to the pharmacy before they closed for the weekend. \n\nI know how this goes. It could be weeks. I didn’t ration my pills, I feel so stupid but when you get them filled for a few months without issue you let your guard down. Now I’m completely out and I’m dealing with the withdrawals. I know work will be the most difficult part. Im competing for a promotion and this might shut it down. My S/o I largely unsympathetic and gets very frustrated with me forgetting things because I’m usually so on top of things. She’s never known me Unmedicated so she doesn’t quite get it. The chronic tiredness is the worst. And the irritability. It’s everything \n\nI just wish I didn’t feel this way. It shouldn’t be this hard. It’s not right. I get that insulin is more important to diabetics, but I’m so sick of the eye rolls and the short answers. No one wants to help, no one wants to try.

Of course, my doctor jumped the gun and sent an old script to a different pharmacy that cannot fill what was requested. So now I’m out of meds and forced to wait and hope. \n\nSo far, I was able to find my meds somewhere. But not this time. Not excited to return to life unmedicated."

I understand the stress this must have been causing on making this community work for all users affected and not affected by the shortage, but this direction feels off to me.  One of the biggest challenges I have with ADHD is \"out of sight, out of mind\".  I will never come back to this thread, not because I don't want to, but because I will forget about it almost immediately.\n\nSeeing posts about the shortage so often has been helpful for me to realize I'm not alone in this struggle and what we're dealing with is unprecedented. \n\nPlease don't start mass removing these posts.  Don't blame the users for a poor product.  This is an issue with reddit, not members of the community.

Name brand was $200, and it was ready in 30 minutes. I wish I had done this months ago. It comes out to less than $7 a day for me to lead a normal life. Ill make any sacrifices necessary, but i was paying $100 for generic so it's not a huge adjustment budget-wise. I easily waste $100 a month on stupid stuff. There's a lot in my life that is going to have to be put back together.

After not being able to get my medication for over 2 months, I FINALLY found a small local pharmacy that could supply my prescription. I'm seriously about to cry writing this. I have no idea whether they'll be able to continue filling it, but it's such a huge win after 2+ months of trying all of the tips/tricks and being left feeling utterly hopeless when they failed.\n\nI had an appointment with my doctor this week and was so defeated-- I was at a breaking point and about to switch to another med that I know isn't a good fit for me just for some stability. But before going to pick the other meds up at my usual CVS, I told myself I would try making ONE last call to a small pharmacy, just to see if they had my original Rx in stock (My partner ended up calling for me because as mentioned I was at breaking point and he's amazing lol). By some act of god, the small pharmacy had it. I got my doctor to transfer the script and picked it up the next morning.\n\nI don't mean for this to be like a \"keep trying!!!!\" post because I had given up trying to work around this fucking mess, and I really don't blame you for doing so either. Seriously so many weeks of making phone calls, sitting on hold, feeling judged by professionals, CRYING...

Given that, you would think that the ADHD medication shortage would be self limiting and would probably be resolved by now due to a decrease in demand, but it's not! There is no end in sight. Where in the hell is all the medication going? Something is very wrong. Either supply is being manupulated/limited or demand is astronomically higher than what is being reported, or both.

They won't fill it unless prompted to and because my Dr sent it in early it was put on hold until I called today.  \nSo I tell them \"I'll talk to you tomorrow then\" and get a *\"Oh you don't need to call everyday, call every few days and you should be fine\".*  \n\"Well you said you don't know when the meds will come in, right?\"  \n*\"Yes\"*  \n\"And you don't do a waiting list so the first one to 'prompt' you when it is in is who gets the fill, right?\"  \n*begrudgingly \"Yes\"*  \n\"Ok, then Ill be calling every day until its filled as I need the meds and can't function day to day without them\".  \nWe are all dealing with issues with this and I have a buffer that I have built up by skipping some meds here and there to make sure I can cover this inevitable issue.

But nobody I talk to can give me a straight answer.\n\nYou ask why you can't get your script filled, they say there's a shortage. Nobody knows why or when it will end, just that there is one.\n\nIt already sucks to ask. You get made to feel like some junkie just for asking.\n\nAnd it's all sort of just happening and nothing is being done about it.\n\nWhose going to stick up for us? The little guys?\n\nMy pharmacy and doctor either can't do anything or don't care to. It's been over a month. And my doctors office refuses to write new prescriptions. I was told directly that if you can't get your medicine filled then you are \"just going to have to wait\".\n\nQuite frankly I'm not sure who I should be mad at, it feels like everyone.\n\nI just don't understand why something like this is an issue that's even capable of happening in 2023. If all the drug facilities that made the drug burned down? Sure. If all the transport trucks that shipped them broke down? Okay.\n\nBut that's not the case at all.

    "comment": "Here are my top takeaways after spending a week+ looking for Adderall in NYC.\n\n**Focus on smaller pharmacies**\n\n\\- With the automatic recording, phone prompts, and hold times, it takes on average 7 minutes to get through to a CVS pharmacist. It's deeply discouraging to spend so much time calling so few pharmacies only to get one no after another. I only started calling CVS/Walgreens after my doctor recommended I do so. It was a complete waste of time.\n\n\\- Most smaller pharmacies have a direct line to the pharmacists. You can talk to 5 or 6 pharmacists in the time it takes to talk to one at CVS or Walgreens. You'll still get a lot of nos but you're using your time much more efficiently and walk away with a greater sense of accomplishment.\n\n**Utilize Yelp to locate pharmacies**\n\n\\- I had trouble finding a list of NYC pharmacies with reliable phone numbers. When using Google Maps, it can be tough to keep track of which ones you've called.\n\n\\- I searched \"Independent Pharmacies\" on Yelp. It provided a numbered list which made it much easier to track and I got through the calls much quicker. I had a block of time and called pharmacies 1-22. When I had time later in the day, I returned to Yelp and started with number 23.\n\n**Try to extract as much information as you can from pharmacist**\n\n\\- Instead of saying what I am specifically looking for (Adderall XR 20MG), I ask \"Do you have Adderall IR or XR in stock\" and then provide the dosage when they ask. It's helpful to know what they have available as I can ask my doctor to amend my script based on that. If they don't have 20MGs, do they have 10MG? Do they have 30MG? Etc.\n\n\\- If they have it in stock, confirm they have the quantity you need.\n\n**ALWAYS follow up to check on status of refill**\n\n**-** Just because your doctor has called in the prescription, don't assume that it is getting filled. Call pharmacy to check status and confirm.\n\nThis is key based on my experiences. 1. A CVS in Brooklyn said they could order my prescription and it would arrive in 2 days. I called to check on it and they said they wouldn't be getting the shipment until July 17. 2. Another pharmacy told me they had the prescription in stock. I called to follow up the next day, after my dr. phoned in my script, and learned that the pharmacist had misspoken and they hadn't had Adderall for weeks.\n\n**Don't give up**\n\n\\- I know. Easier said than done. Believe me, it's been a roller coaster. I have called over 100 pharmacies. Of those, only one has had my prescription (20MG XR) in stock. However, by the time my dr. called it in, they were out.\n\nOTHER TIPS\n\n**IR over XR.** Nowhere I have called this week has XR. Although still hard to find, you have a better chance of finding IR.\n\n**Timing of pharmacy calls.** I call pharmacies in the afternoon. I know my doctor waits until the end of the day to call in prescriptions. If I find a pharmacy that has my medication in stock at 9am, there is a good chance that by the time he phones it in at 6 or 7pm, they will be out.\n\n**Help with calls.** I asked my mom, who knows just how critical it is that I take Adderall daily (I've been on it for 22 years and take a high dosage), to call pharmacies too. I made her a simple phone script. While she has only made about 10 in total so far.. it's better than nothing. Thanks Mom :)\n\n**Contact your rep.** I beg you to do so. Nothing is being done about this. Each and every rep and senator needs to know the toll this shortage is taking on their constituents. Find your rep here: [https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member](https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member)\n\n***Finally, this thorough list would not have been possible without Adderall. None of this would have been. Thankfully, I have a couple more days' worth. After that, I am screwed.***"

    "comment": "Can a mod add some information to the main post about how to contact elected representatives? From reading this thread, I get the feeling that if people were furiously calling senators and reps as much like they have been to various pharmacies, something would have been done about this by now.\n\nEDIT: Here are some steps to follow:\n\n1. Go to [https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials](https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials) and find your elected officials by inputting your street address.\n2. The three most important individuals are at the federal level: your two senators and representatives. You can write local and state officials, as well, but just know that they can't address the issue directly; you'd have to urge them to put pressure upward.\n3. Write each senator and your representative a polite and clear letter about the ongoing crisis. Nowadays, you can do that through email or a form on their websites, but maybe it would be worth sending a physical letter, too.\n4. Save their offices' phone numbers to your phone's contacts so you can stay in touch easily. Don't harass them or be rude; these are just interns and office clerks. Be clear, polite, and to the point; by the time you get off the phone, the clerk should be 100% clear about why you're calling and what your position is.\n\n**One letter or phone call won't change the politician's mind.** Rather, the aids, clerks, and interns at their offices will inform their employer of issues that seem to be getting a lot of traction. **The squeaky wheel gets the grease.** If everyone reading this thread contacted their electeds and had their friends and family do the same, this crisis would be taken a lot more seriously.\n\nIf you have any particularly horrifying experiences with the shortage, include them in your letter (probably not the phone call unless it's really quick). Politicians like to use those anecdotes in public speeches, like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCRipHwXKdY). It can go a long way toward humanizing a problem that would otherwise seem very abstract to people not directly affected by it.\n\nHere's a letter template based on the letters I sent to my senators and representatives. Feel free to take it and adapt it as you see fit. Just remember to be **polite and clear**.  \n\n\n>Dear, (THEIR NAME).  \n>  \n>My name is (NAME) and I’m a constituent of yours in (TOWN, STATE). I’m contacting you regarding the ongoing shortage of medications prescribed for ADHD. This shortage has negatively affected the lives of many of your constituents and millions of people from around the country. I am strongly urging you to solve this dire problem.  \n>  \n>Far from being a set of annoying personality traits, ADHD is a well-documented neurological disorder often associated with the prefrontal lobe of the brain. It negatively affects so-called Executive Functions, which include the ability to pay attention as well as sensory processing, time management, and short-term memory.  \n>  \n>These impairments can have severe negative effects on the lives of those with ADHD, but fortunately, medical stimulants are proven to ameliorate these issues and greatly improve their lives. For example, medicated individuals with ADHD are less like to experience substance abuse and more likely to keep a steady job. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that this ongoing shortage of medical stimulants is a major crisis in the lives of those with ADHD as well as their friends and families. Considering that experts estimate that around 10% of the country might experience some form of ADHD, having that percentage of the workforce not able to carry out their jobs correctly due to the shortage should be considered a major economic problem as well.  \n>  \n>This medication shortage has affected me as well. (INSERT PERSONAL EXPERIENCE)  \n>  \n>The causes of the shortage are not clear and a number of factors seem to be contributing to it. Here are some steps that can be taken that could alleviate this crisis:\n\n* mandate that the DEA permit manufacturers to make more stimulant medication.\n* incentivize manufacturers to produce more generics.\n* diminish restrictions on how much stock pharmacies can have, which were recently put in place as a result of class-action lawsuits related to the opioid epidemic.\n\n>If these measures are insufficient at solving the ongoing crisis, it might be worth reconsidering stimulants’ current scheduling. I‘m not diminishing the importance of addressing serious drug abuse, but it’s worth pointing out that these medications aren’t anywhere near as deadly as others in Schedule II. These medications have come a long way from the 1970s, when stimulants were first moved up from Schedule III. Rescheduling would be a dramatic step, but we shouldn’t lose sight of how dramatic the situation already is for millions of sufferers of ADHD who are trying their best to navigate this shortage.  \n>  \n>Drug abuse is a serious issue and I’m sure current measures are made with good intentions, but these shouldn’t be carried out at the expense of sufferers of ADHD who are just trying to lead healthy, happy, and productive lives. I once again strongly urge you to address this ongoing shortage of ADHD medication with great haste.  \n>  \n>Thank you for your time."

    "comment": "I have been taking generic Dexedrine since 1990 when I was diagnosed as a 19-year-old community college student.  I had always struggled in school, diagnosed with a non-specific learning disability in 4th grade (now I know it was ADHD - inattentive).  \n\nDexedrine changed my life; it gave me the ability to focus during class and actually read my textbooks.  I quickly became a 3.5 student. I was present in my life, making friends and interacting with the world.   I graduated from community college.  Then got my BS degree and then my Masters.  I have a successful career in financial management.  Over the past 30-plus years, Dexedrine allowed me to thrive.\n\nI have no doubt that if I had not gotten diagnosed back then, I would have never finished school and probably would never have been able to hold down a job for long.  Without Dexedrine, I am sure my life would have taken a very different and sad path.\n\nPlease note when I was diagnosed with ADHD,  Adderall was not on the market; it came out in 1996.  I have never tried Adderall because Dexedrine worked well, and for many years Dexedrine was much cheaper than Adderall as well.   \n\nBut now I can't get my hands on it, but every other month (if I am lucky). I ration it, but my work, my home, and my relationships are all suffering because I don't have consistent access to Dexedrine.   I don't think our government gets it.    They act like these meds are, at most, a nice to have for adults.  Like I am using it to get some sort of high or just an extra pep in my step.   \n\nI know people abuse it, but there are many people like me (and you) who can't navigate life without it.  Now I fear I am going to lose all that I worked so hard to get because the government thinks stopping abuse is more important than making sure there is a supply enough out there for the people who need it.\n\nWhat can we do? I mean, other than complaining on TikTok and Reddit.   Would writing our congress members work? The FDA has been placating us since January with dates when it should be resolved, and those dates have come and gone, and I still can't get my Dexedrine.  Why hasn't there been an organized effort on the part of people living with ADHD to make it clear that we are suffering and our lives have been materially impacted by this ongoing shortage?????? Is it because we don't have our meds that we can't get ourselves to focus enough to show an organized front?\n\nOur government has the power to make ADHD drugs more accessible and ensure there is enough for everyone in need.   Maybe the  FDA and the DEA are not at fault at all for the situation, but they have the power to lift the roadblocks and help to get us our meds until a better oversight solution is found.  They did it with baby formula; now they should do it with something almost as important to those of us that suffer from ADHD  \n\nAnyhow, in typical ADHD style, this post has no specific actionable request or question.  I just wanted to share my  ADHD story to hopefully give more credibility that ADHD is debilitating and how medication and treatment for it is life-changing. Thanks for reading!"

I thought they meant 10mg but no, 10 tablets left in the whole damn pharmacy. And they don’t have RX. I’ve heard people saying they’ve had to pay full price for a partial fill??? I fucking hope not because while my insurance has changed it’s still probably gonna be $100 plus without RX. \nWith adderall, I was barely managing full-time work and school, now I’m at the breaking point trying to keep up. Literally the worst possible time for me not to have my medication. Ive gone without adhd meds before plenty of times when it’s been too expensive. And while it could be hard, and I was definitely not very efficient, I managed. But now I’ve been so overwhelmed I’ve even been having to set timers and write things down just so I don’t accidentally neglect my cat :(. She’s doing great and I’m dedicating my remaining brain cells to her, but it kills me that I’m struggling with something I put before anything. \nI’m at the point where I briefly thought about buying it illegally (not sure if just mentioning this is against the rules). But I live rurally and I don’t think anyone even deals it here and it’s not worth the risk. And to all of you who might be considering that, remember that while there’s an admittedly low but still serious risk of fentanyl contamination, there is a reasonably high chance it has meth in it. Just don’t do it. \nI’ve been reaching out for help for once and I know I will get through this. Bit fuck, an already extremely difficult time in my life has been made almost impossible by this, and I know so many people here are going through the same thing :(. Stay strong y’all"

I kept reading these articles saying people just called around til they found a pharmacy with it in stock. Where I live (Atlanta) that’s not even a possible solution.\n\nIf our normal pharmacy is out we’re SOL.\n- pharmacies in our area don’t disclose s2 medication stock status to patients without having their prescription.\n- Escripts are used for s2 meds, which are non transferrable. \n- doctors can call the pharmacy for that information but don’t have the personnel to do this for all their patients. Due to the shortage, my doctors had to make a policy that they’ll only call a patients prescription in to one other pharmacy (which is only helpful if you know the other pharmacy has it in stock which you can’t find out without having it called in, it’s a catch22). \n\nIn the past 20ish years since I began taking medication for my ADHD there were brief shortages  but they pale in comparison to the nightmare that’s currently happening. I was without my meds for a month last year in March (had issues beginning in Jan of 22’). I had to struggle to get my meds filled until fall of last year when I finally switched to a different pharmacy because of this. I didn’t want to switch pharmacies as I had been a patient there for 7 years but I didn’t see any other option at that point. Now my new pharmacy has also been impacted by the shortage. I’ve been unable to get my prescription filled for 2 weeks. My doctor called in alternative medication (which also causes me anxiety bc brain chemistry is complex and I don’t know how diff meds will interact with me) but the first was not covered by my insurance and would have cost $304 so they called in a second alternative which was also out of stock due to the shortage. So I’m still without any treatment options and no ETA for when I will be able to get either my normal prescription or the alternative filled. \n\nThis shortage has severely affected my mental health and quality of life. Every month feels like a cruel anxiety inducing stressful game of Russian roulette of if I will be able to get my meds filled or not. I live alone and don’t have the blessing of others to support me through this madness. I worry if I’ll be let go bc of how severe my adhd is when I’m unmedicated. I worry that  I’ll get flagged by the bullshit algorithms that the dea has managed to pressure pharmacies and drs into using to assign abuse risk scores to patients bc of the shortage rendering my normal treatment unavailable. \n\nWriting this is even a struggle bc I know my thoughts are disorganized, my apologies… Please pass on my gratitude to the bureaucratic bullshit quotas and  medical experts at the DEA for causing this nightmare and it’s detrimental impact on the lives and patient care of millions of Americans…FFS."

If people on here start making it known through letters, emails, petitions etc. it will get noticed, I assure you.  I humbly suggest starting an association to represent people with legitimate ADD/HD Diagnoses that require medications that are broadly mentioned here and to raise funds to donate to politicians— it will get their attention.  :) understanding of course getting around to forming the association, and all of the things necessary to do that is not easy but there are a ton of smart, gifted people here that can contribute their time and efforts in specific ways…  I cannot find an association that represents folks with ADHD compromised of adhd folks. \n\nWe would start it as a state non profit in the state with the most users… and file for a 501c6 so it can donate to political parties. My guess is that manufacturers pharmacists academics etc would donate to it eventually.  Over time, the association could even build or contract to make its own meds as a non profit manufacturer! But not to get ahead of myself \n\nWould need a proper governance structure, with accountability, major transparency , a strong executive director, strong board of directors, and strong tech presence, and a strong contracted  lobbying organization. \n\nI will donate $2k to help start it but we would\nNeed major participation from lots of people to make it work, meet and sort it out legally and go from there.\n\nJust my two cents!"

The manufacturers that COULD make more, decided NOT to make more (I’m looking at you, Teva). Simply put, not every company harvested all of their stimulant Ingredients this year.

I assume that these quotas don’t roll over into the next year, and are not transferable to another manufacturer, bc I’m sure some of them would have been happy to make 130% of their product.\n\nHigher demand, schedule 2, labor shortages, tighter regulations, and feral capitalism are to blame for this situation.\n\nFeel better?

How many people know what a NDC code is?\n\n1) My doctor does not and cannot prescribe medication using a NDC number or specifying a certain manufacturer. Only the drug, tablet or dosage amount, frequency taken are on the prescription.\n\n2) The pharmacy chain I use receives the doctor’s prescription and places an order for it using their ordering process. The insurance information is also verified. Also I think for my state there is a check made to make sure I’m not receiving multiple prescriptions of the same thing each month. (And this is getting ridiculous!)\n\n3) The pharmacy chain ordering department has contracts with various manufacturers but not all of them. Normally they would send their order to the least cost manufacturer.\n\n4) If the manufacturer does not have any product available, it notifies the pharmacy chain ordering department who notifies my pharmacy who notifies me that my prescription cannot be filled. All the pharmacist tells me is that they can resubmit the order and “hope for the best”. (In my state, if the pharmacy has only a partial amount of my prescription available, they offer it to me as an option. Except that I cannot get the remaining balance filled if my order comes in. I am stuck with the partial amount for the whole month even if my doctor submits a new prescription. That is, I can only have only ONE prescription filled each month no matter what. My doctor sends to my pharmacy three 1-month prescriptions for 3 months. I ask the pharmacy to order the 3 months supply, fill the current prescription, and hold the remaining 2 months in their stock for me. They cannot “pre-order”. They have to wait to order my monthly prescription until 2 days prior to the date when I can pick it up. And if my order cannot be filled, I run out of medication… What a MESS!\n\n5) I cannot ask/tell/demand that the pharmacy’s ordering department call around to different manufacturers to find one who can supply the product. After all, they have “contracts”.\n\n5a) My pharmacy cannot call around to other local pharmacies in their chain to see if they have any in-stock available. They suggest I call around to other local pharmacy chain stores. If I happen to find one with a supply, I cannot have them send it to my local pharmacy. My local pharmacy cannot send them my prescription directly. I have to obtain a new prescription from my doctor to be sent to the new pharmacy. And I can’t have two prescriptions “open” for the same month. This has become a monthly nightmare!\n\n6) I can wait until the pharmacy can fill my prescription. NOT an option!\n\n7) I can try a different pharmacy chain hoping they use different manufacturers for supply. But again I have no information which manufacturers the chain uses. My pharmacy chain used to change manufacturers about every 2-6 months. I hate this because generics all affect me differently. I know they aren’t supposed to but the do.\n\n8) I could try changing medications and go through the trial and error ordeal of getting a correct dosage. Am I  willing to changing medications due to ever-changing conditions and regulations?\n\n9) To improve drug distribution NOT!, the DEA is now involved tracking doctors, pharmacies, and manufacturers to “discourage” doctors and pharmacies from over-prescribing. (I.e. pill shops)\n\nUnfortunately there are doctors and government officials (elected, appointed, or hired) who believe: \n\n1) Adult ADHD is a scam and doesn’t exist, therefore there shouldn’t be any medications to treat this “scam”, \n\n2) Childhood ADHD is over-diagnosed and over-prescribed."

Though I’ve seen many people say they it does not help their ADHD much, it might be useful on days focus is less of a priority, thus stretching out the stimulant supply. Plus, for me it was much better than doing without. The downside is insurance typically doesn’t cover it from what I understand. I paid 31.00 with GoodRX, but it so far seems worth the money."

Eventually found one pharmacy that had 20 count of brand name on my dosage. A few months ago I was able to get the brand name covered by my insurance with no extra hoops to jump through, I guess because of the shortage. Then 2 months ago the pharmacy told me brand name was denied. Fortunately I was able to give generic pretty easily at that time.\n\nThat's not the case anymore, so I called my insurance to ask for an override due to the national shortage, and after 45 minutes on the phone with the rep, she said that it wouldn't be covered because it would need an override. I about fucking lost it. Like yes, I know, that's what I asked for 45 minutes ago! So another day goes by unmedicated\n\nTo make matters worse, I'm in between psychs right now because my old one graduated and they were supposed to call me 2 months ago to get me scheduled with a new resident and they never did, and I forgot to check in with them because I have adhd.\n\nMy old psych would've just changed me to Adderall for the month, but the new one whom I am now scheduled with is not comfortable changing my meds without seeing me.\n\nMy PCP is usually my backup prescriber but she's not comfortable changing meds either, and her NP is out of town so she's hard to get a hold of anyways.\n\nEven more fun is that I'm supposed to be starting a new job next week.

Fingers crossed that solution will continue to be viable for a while, but given the ongoing shortages across our medications, I'll be calling pharmacies WELL in advance of my next refill time to confirm if this dosage is even still available.\n\nAs a related note, I'm sure a lot of other people join me in being absolutely furious that the over-enforcement of our meds means our time window between \"When we are allowed to refill\" and \"when we run out\" is so tiny.  When anything goes wrong with the process (like what is happening right now with shortages expanding into more and more forms of ADHD medication) we are put at risk for being unmedicated on a monthly basis, with very little time available to find a solution."

It is so frustrating that I don't know if I will be able to get my medication until the day before I run out. Historically, I take meds every day unless I'm sick, so I don't have a lot of backstock. Having to call around and get a prescription sent to a pharmacy already sucks; it sucks even more to have to do it unmedicated and at the last minute. \n\nI'm unnecessarily paranoid about getting labeled as drug seeking, and will only ask if other people have had luck with this approach."

    "comment": "I had the worst experience at CVs pharmacy today. Back story: I’ve been having to use Adzenys instead of generic Adderall during the shortage. My insurance is a generic only plan. So for the last 7 months or so, I have to have the pharmacist enter a coupon online to fill it. It has to be completed by the pharmacy (per the directions) and has to be done each month. So each month, I run around on the 29th day to get the script started and at times have to wait for it because it is out. Every month, I get a notice from CVS to get a different prescription because my insurance won’t fill it. Every month I have to call and beg them to follow the directions to enter the coupon. Every month they try to enter the coupon from the month before and it says it’s invalid. EVERY MONTH. if I’m lucky, there will be a pharmacist on staff that knows what do and I don’t have to wait. \n\nToday I called and attempted to explain again that the pharmacist would have to go online to enter the info. This time, the pharmacist argued with me, told me he didn’t know how to do it and that I would just have to call back Wednesday (2 days from now) to get the other pharmacist to do it. When I insisted that the directions say the pharmacy would just need to go online to get the coupon, he told me that was my responsibility. I have gotten coupons before so I know that most times they have you give them the info. This does not say that. This has the pharmacy go online to enter their info to get the coupon code. Anyways, the pharmacist ended up hanging up on me. I went in to the store with the info again. Instead of serving me, he gave me a lecture on how I was rude because I pointed out he was being rude. I had stood in line at the counter to give this info behind several people for several minutes. Even after standing in line, he told me I would need to wait behind the others waiting on their prescriptions to fill before he would even begin to look at the coupon and start the prescription. Anyways, I just messaged my doc to move it to a different pharmacy. The pharmacist basically didn’t want to have to do the extra work required so he just said he didn’t know how. Now I’m out of meds and will have to wait another day to get it filled. Sucks."

Our elected Congressman could have easily brought legislation to bear requiring certain drug companies to produce adequate quantities of these medications to fill everyone’s needs with the passing of a simple mandate for other initiatives. If there are restrictions on the price manufacturers can charge in order for production to be profitable then lift them. I don't believe that the chemicals necessary to make the medication are difficult to acquire or formulate. I think it's quite the opposite. I think DEA and FDA restrictions are completely artificial and I don't believe that our congressmen don't have the power to overrule those organizations. I don't believe that the legislators simply don't know there is a national shortage millions and millions of people are suffering from it. And this matter is not a partisan issue. It's time for Congress to act. We need swift legislation to dissipate the anxiety and misery our community suffers from this arcane punishment. They are creating unnecessary misery for millions and it's an artificial construct. This \"nobody knows nothing\" lack of answers is total nonsense. There are powers that be that are causing this misery and it's about time that our community brought them to task. Forget the FDA and the DEA. Let's start signing petitions and calling up our congressmen until their lines are jammed and let them know: no action, no vote.

The diagnosis and meds were a life saver until I couldn’t find them… I have resorted to taking vitamins that (I need to take anyway) help me stay accountable for my health and also keep me in the habit. This whole shortage has been extremely frustrating to say the least. \n\nNow I will be going into a tiny rant on drugs.\n\nMy mother passed away in 2014 due to a drug mishap (not an overdose just took a pill at the wrong time) now my mother was a prescription drug addict and it was bad, it got to the point that she would change pharmacies just because they wouldn’t fill a script because of the other medications she was on, so she would just go to another pharmacy and fill it. Now you may be asking why she even gets the script in the first place well to put it bluntly she was in school to be a nurse and would basically self diagnose herself and tell her DR what she needed and why. And he would write out the script fully trusting that she knew what she was talking about but, she didn’t; she was just really good at convincing people…\n\nWhen I heard that one of the reasons for this shortage was because they don’t think they(DEA) need to make more because they are worried about abuse is just really frustrating. Why don’t they do that with the opiates and pain killers? (Moms drugs) huh? Why not put more restrictions on the actual drugs that people abuse? Amphetamines are only a danger to someone who doesn’t have adhd/add and it’s a life long drug not a short term med like pain killers (most of the time) \n\nThey put all the blame on a singular drug and fail to realize the real problem and it’s doctors who are too ignorant and have too much of a God complex to truly care for a patient. \n\nThe drug is not the problem \n\nDRs who over prescribe unnecessary meds is the real problem."

I phoned Carelon and asked if Zenzedi was in stock and if I could have my Rx filled with it. I was told it was, but I needed to submit a new Rx for \"Zenzedi\".

DAW means dispense as written) and I mailed it to Carelon and for my $15 copay 12 days later I received  Zenzedi.\n\nImpressions: It is good! Works well at controlling my adhd.

Reason being is Smith, Kline and French hold the original patent for amphetamine (US patent number 1,879,003 dated September 27, 1932), which also covers the dextro isomer). Smith, Kline and French originally marketed the dextro isomer of amphetamine as Dexidrine or Dextrostat in the 1940s in 5 and 10 mg tablets, so these sizes are not new formulations. Sizes other than 5 and 10 mg tablets are new formulations because no other pharma company marketed them as name brands.\n\nZenzedi is sold by Arbor Pharmaceuticals. I have read in several places that Wilshire Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Arbor, actually manufactures all sizes of dextroamphetamine tablets for Arbor. Wilshire also markets 10 and 5 mg dextroamphetamine tablets as a generic (which I have never been able to get). The generic tablets are the exact size, shape, and color as the name brand tablets. Likewise, the lettering and number imprinted on them is identical. They are indistinguishable.\n\nNow the pricing is something I do not understand. My Rx of Zenzedi retails for about $1350 (per GoodRx). But per my insurance company's explanation of benefits it states their cost is about $38. Deduct my $15 copay and my insurer paid $23 for a medication that retails for almost 60 times more! Something is seriously wrong with this price structure. The uninsured are truely getting gouged and big pharma is getting filthy rich from their price gouging."

    "comment": "Currently on Adderall XR for ADHD. 20 MG a day. Called into my doc's office Tuesday. Needed my meds by Thursday, he called the Adderall in same day. Come Thursday, still no meds. Walgreens says it is delayed, but they'll call around and ask, expect a call in an hour. If I stick with them, I can get my meds between \"an hour from now and Monday\"- remember it is currently Thursday. Two hours later I call back, guy who answers is confused and says that the previous lady probably called and I missed it. He'll check for me, expect a call by tomorrow. I confirm my phone number (first lady put it in 100% wrong, somehow).  \nCut to next morning, nothing. Call at 2pm. Lady who answers says \"what do you want.\" I explain. She says \"we can't call in on scheduled drugs, call yourself\" then hangs up.  \nAt this point I'm about to cry. I've used up my last emergency pill that day (keep in mind that over the past year I have saved up exactly 2 pills for this sort of situation). I have been on Adderall for twelve years and haven't missed a single day. I cannot stand how I feel without it. Everything is too fast and not being on it makes my stomach feel like a pit. I get super hungry and before I was on Adderall I was 40 pounds overweight (not that weight loss is a big reason I was on it, but still. Even just a day off of it, I know I'll be eating myself out of house and home).  \nCall three Walgreens. Nobody has it. Cut to Saturday, first day off of my meds. I'm panicking, and take a double dose of my sleeping medicine to hopefully sleep through the day (don't worry, my doc said it's safe to do so on occassion if I have issues sleeping!). I wake up at 3pm utterly spent and feeling like I'm about to do a Wiley Coyote through the wall. I hit up the store and grab enough diet coke to choke a horse. It's just till Monday. 4am, according to the online portal. I can do this.  \nSunday. Time jumps from 4am to 6pm. Well ain't that great. I actually start crying at this point. I can't do a third day. I'm currently looking for a job and can't do any job interviews like this. I can barely get out of bed to take care of my animals. Even with that, my mother had to help because I got distracted and started dressing my bearded dragons up as wild west cowboys.  \nTen mintues ago I double check my medications. Now it says 1am on Tuesday. And I just know that'll keep climbing. And I can't call again... they'll just think I'm drug seeking. I've gotten it all before. Everyone I've talked to at this pharmacy gets this snide / judging tone when I mention my medication. I hate ADHD. If I could get rid of it i could.  \nI'm really sorry for the rant. I'm sure once I get on my meds I'll look back and cringe at it. I needed to get this off my chest. Nobody else in real life understands, the only things I've gotten from family is that \"this is a good thing, you sound addicted to this medicine!\" and \"why are you sitting around all day, I never let my (physical!) disability stop me!\". Which... I've taken it for twelve years now non-stop. I've gotten used to feeling \"normal\" and in control and now it feels like everything is falling apart around me. Of course I feel like I need it. I can and would stop taking it if some study came out saying it's slowly killing me. But this isn't that! It's just that stupid shortage."

    "comment": "After 2 weeks of waiting, calling more than 100 pharmacies, splitting my remaining 70mg Vyvanse to ration, and 3 days on just my 10 mg Adderall booster I bit the bullet and asked my psychiatrist to send a prescription for something else.\n\nI put off switching my medication because Vyvanse has worked well for me for more than a decade and I tried my fair share of medications (Adderall, Concerta, Focalin) when first diagnosed to varying degrees of success. I was also really worried that I would fill a new prescription and then the shortage would end and I would be stuck for a month. But I could feel my anxiety and self loathing rising as the week went on and I watched my work pile up.\n\nMy psych recommended Dextroamphetamine 15mg twice a day as a replacement, it was filled in 3 hours. Saturday was my first day and honestly it's been a decent  substitute. Part of why I liked Vyvanse is it worked longer than other medications without a strong come up or come down and I have found the same to be true Dextroamphetamine (so far). Today will be the first real test since it's a work day, although I was able to catch up on a lot of the work I fell behind on over the weekend. \n\nFeeling like I am pulling myself out of last week's spiral, but too early to say for sure.\n\nThis is already longer than I would read but I will thread an update in case anyone is interested. I hope you are all able to fill your meds, and if you have to make a switch that it works well for you too.\n\nTLDR - Ended up switching my meds for the first time in over a decade because of the shortage. Despite how anxious the thought of switching was, it seems to be significantly better than the self loathing that was creeping in from falling behind."

I was never medicated as a child because my younger siblings’ mental health took precedence over mine. I managed to get myself medicated in my early 20’s and it COMPLETELY CHANGED MY LIFE. I was finally able to properly function to my full potential, get things done, remember things, follow through with things, be a “normal human.” \nI’ve been taking Concerta for like, 10 years. I only take it on work days, don’t use it on weekends. \nAs all of you know, there’s a medication shortage. I couldn’t get my prescription anywhere and eventually, after calling like five pharmacies and miraculously finding one that did have a small quantity of meds left, out of desperation I paid $400 for a months supply of name the name brand (before I’d been buying generic because it was much cheaper, even with health insurance).  I used a credit card. I CANNOT afford that, and my regular pharmacy hasn’t had stock in a while. So I’ve decided that I’m going to have to go without.\nI’ll be honest it’s been DEBILITATING not having my medication. I’m suffering. My work is suffering. Anything that I need to be 100 percent on my game is suffering. \nI’m incredibly sad about how I’m no longer capable of doing things this medication has helped allow me to do for years.\nI’ve realized there’s nothing I can do. \nI cannot afford to pay ridiculous amounts for a months worth of medication. \nI have to just grin and bear it.\nSo now we get to my point; Does anyone have any advice on how to….. I don’t know, Live? Function? Be able to follow through with projects? \nHonestly ANY advice is welcome, I feel like my ADHD is just completely out of control. Is there anything I can do?"

The main problem being that it cost me $70 because apparently insurance hasn't caught up to the generics yet according to the pharmacy tech.\n\nCVS also doesn't seem to know about the [DEA's changed regulations regarding electronic transfers](https://www.dea.gov/stories/2023/2023-09/2023-09-01/revised-regulation-allows-dea-registered-pharmacies-transfer). Not only were they unwilling to transfer my prescription, but both the techs and the actual pharmacist had no idea these regulatory changes had even happened (yet somehow my physiatrist has known since early August when I received an email about the regulations changing).\n\nA follow-up call with corporate's feedback line revealed to me that their systems can't transfer controlled substance scripts between pharmacies *at all*, including between other CVS pharmacies. There is supposedly no override for this either.\n\nSo keep that in mind and make sure your script is sent to the right pharmacy, or hope your CVS experience is a lot more competent than mine was."

You'd expect that they could easily swap it since they should be the same dose. Nope. They required a brand new prescription from my doctor. I had to beg with my doctor to process it that day.

Their responses to the ongoing shortage are very weak, to put it lightly, and they almost never push back against (for example) poor representations of ADHD in the media. Compare that to the American Diabetes Association's very extensive [advocacy page](https://diabetes.org/get-involved/advocacy). As long as there's no group carrying out public advocacy on behalf of those with ADHD, we're just going to have to keep hoping that the politicians and society at large just become enlightened on their own."

    "comment": "Spot on. I won’t be surprised if the fallout of all of this will end with a slew of lawsuits. At least attempting to prove that there was no decent reason for there to have been a shortage that has lasted as long as it has (and according to the last pharmacist I spoke to has no end in sight), therefore proving intentionality behind the shortage of medication….and because we are no longer in a pandemic, the excuse about any “uncertainty surrounding the increase in diagnoses” is irrelevant—especially as MORE people seem to be having trouble finding meds than before.\n\nFor the first time, I also have the weird feeling that the medication isn’t working as it should (only in the sense that it is WEAKENED in potency—nothing else regarding different fillers added or anything). I can’t stay awake and haven’t been able to with my most recent Rx of 50mg Mydayis, along with 20mg IR adderall which I usually break in half and take twice during the day or the entire 20 in the early evening when I no longer feel the effects of Mydayis (which is supposed to last 16 hours, but XR adderall was only effective for ~6 hours max for me. So the fact that I’ve been unable to even get up to RE-WASH a cycle of clothes that my mom washed (and apparently told me I’d need to move to the dryer) 3 days ago so they don’t get mildewy and gross is WEIRD and concerning. And the fact that I’m sleeping so hard on 50mg mydayis+20mg IR adderall both taken after I wake up and start “planning my day” sitting up in bed and at some point passing out for anywhere from 4-10 hours isn’t normal.\n\nHas anyone else felt that their BRAND NAME medication has felt less effective??! It’s hard for me to discern if it’s “working” my going off of anything other than its ability to keep me awake during the day really, bc mydayis doesn’t give me that initial jittery feeling that adderall did, which also means no symptoms of any “come down” (which is why I’m so happy with the medication—which HAS been working super well until now!).\n\nAnyways, I feel like the amount of people with diagnosed ADHD experiencing job losses and perhaps getting into car accidents that will align with their inability to acquire the medication that is NEEDED for many to live a *safe* and *somewhat functional* life (there are multiple other things I could list off that I assume is happening amongst those with adhd as a result of an inability to acquire meds, but I don’t want to get into triggering territory)….ok so to finish that thought (lolz)—that data will undoubtedly show the correlation between the government not doing what they very easily could and WOULD do for probably almost any other medication to make it available to those who need it—and I assume, HAVE DONE plenty of times—which SHOULD provide enough evidence that they were neglectful and negligent toward a decent percentage of the population who have struggled in multiple different ways because of said neglect.\nI’m FAR FROM BEING A LAWYER so anyone who knows law please correct me….I should ask my brother too. I’m assuming that it’s almost next to impossible for any lawsuit against an agency of the US government in a case like this if it’s a single person, and unfortunately I don’t see practitioners stepping up, despite their witnessing this insanity, for fear of losing their license.\n\nBut I know there have been cases when one of the governing agencies has been held responsible for someone getting cancer as a result of known exposure to toxins in their line of work. \n\nI just don’t understand how this is effing legal. I was able to type this ramble of a long comment, but. If anyone could see the position I’m in😂😂😂 fetal position in bed with torso twisted to face up, ipad set on top leg and right arm going numb because it’s propped on a water bottle so I can type properly. And I’ve slept all day. THAT’s how crazy daisy lazy this bish is. \n\nFIGHT THE POWERRRRRR! I wish. I was def meant to live in the 60s. I’m just too freaking tired to know how to try and make organized change happen—and if it’s even possible these days…after we’ve seen human rights that have been gained over the past decades suddenly stripped from multiple groups of people (other than wealthy white men, I guess). I live in Texas, so I guess I’ve been exposed to more horrors of the government that’s a result of our horrific state government and their immoral practices that have causes numerous tragic deaths that should NEVER have happened. Greg Abbott should be sued for 2nd degree murder….anyone with thorough knowledge about what’s *actually* been occurring at the border will def understand that.’\n\nOmg am I really this adhd…?

I’m sure anyone who has an autoimmune condition or any kind of infectious disease (wait i actually don’t know if Im familiar with any remotely common infectious diseases other than those that are tick borne, haha) can also understand the issue that arises when medication is suddenly cut off, so our schedules (*especially* sleep schedules) can get completely turned around, which is a problem in itself as sleeping is a common issue for people dealing with health situations like this; but there’s also the issue of not being able to stay on any kind of medical protocol. \nI straight up can’t and don’t get out of my bed (I also have complex late stage Lyme disease, so I know that is a contributing factor to the *extreme* lethargy that comes over me); so that causes many an issue, as I don’t keep up with my protocols on these days, since the only time I’m awake is at some random hour in the night, where I have to go chug a water bottle…\nwhile I should be taking all of the herbals/tinctures/supplements at the same time every day and that requires me to be awake from breakfast to post-dinner.\nI’m also supposed to do as much detox as possible which includes getting in my infrared sauna (it’s the portable kind), and epson salt baths/dry brushing. At least SOMETHING a every day since I have every single coinfection and now mold toxicity/illness and heavy metal toxicity on top of those (aka “opportunistic infections” that can come in forms other than “infections” as well…they just need a weakened immune system!), probs due to a genetic mutation (literally called the MTHFR mutation—tis so fittingly named; and I have the double mutation woooo!) which hinders the bod’s ability to detox.\n\nInterestingly, after the 14 doctors I saw that couldn’t find the correct diagnosis—even though I looked and felt like I was bout tah die!—there were 4 in my city that I’ve trusted with approaching treatment properly (none were of the mainstream western type after q4 of *them* ~lolol~ failed me) So since detox is one of the biggest issues for me, I asked each of them if I should get off of my adhd medication (taking into consideration that it’s putting some degree of taxation on the liver); and pretty hilariously, all of them were QUITE quick to respond with an emphatic “no”, said in different variations😂 So if a holistic practitioner, a functional medical practitioner, a Chinese medical practitioner, and one who mixed different types all concluded that—despite any conflicts with healing (at least the speed) that ADHD meds could have (I’m on highest dose mydayis), even doctors who typically do what they can to refrain from having patients take these meds believing I very much needed them in order to….”get by” I guess? HAHAHA—AH THAT MEANS THEY COULD TELL MY VERY SURVIVAL WAS AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT DEPENDENT ON ME TAKING ADHD MEDICATION!!1! Hahaha that may be overdramatizing, but there was clearly a reason they thought it was necessary. \n\nMANY OF US LITERALLY CANT LIVE LIFE BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY ARE DOING, I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW IT IS LEGALLLLLL!!! \n\nI totally understand if they want anyone who was diagnosed via telehealth to receive an in person assessment/diagnosis now that Covid is over….but why do they think they can punish everyone because there was a flipping worldwide pandemic? \n\nOk hehe doubt anyone read this but needed to rant, and rant over🙃\n\nAlways thinking about the rest of you who are struggling, some more than the rest of us😣, and I hope you’re finding ways to cope if you’re still having trouble with meds (apparently adderall IR is completely out at all pharmacies in the giant ass city that i live in, so I imagine others aren’t having much luck with IR either). And I very much hope for everyone here’s sake that they fix this shiz soon!\n\nThe best advice I have is to try and laugh at yourself, lolz. I’ve been so isolated and living solo, not socializing or seeing anyone but for some reason I find most situations just….funny. So if you CAN, dig deep for the giggles. And I didn’t realize how creepy the word “giggles” is until now and vow never to say it again.\n\n\nEdit: an FYI, every time I comment anywhere or send a text in my fam group thread, they have to be in essay format. I literally don’t know how to NOT “overshare”. So the above is a prime example of adhd HA"

    "comment": "As much as I agree that more left-leaning politicians and advocates would and have been more reasonable/empathetic towards proposing and advancing policies to help patients in need, I think an overall push on education across the board on a societal level in what these medications mean for us as individuals with no choice in having Adhd and chronic health conditions in general. That is to say, many corporate Democrats and Republicans are two sides of the same coin. Not to say Republicans are more reasonable, because the current state of the party is definitely more into science-denial and defunding of social programs and supports than the Democrats. Just that even with progressives who mean well, discussion on regulation when it comes to mental health treatment for many is still misunderstood and under-discussed. Such as misplaced telehealth provisions and restrictions for patients in underrepresented and impoverished areas stuck in a battle between Medicaid and Medicare, and private insurers. Something Republicans also push for but under the guise of preventing addiction via the mythical upholding of Regan's war on drugs.\n\nI was undiagnosed until 2021, a year after losing my mother and the initial surge of the covid-19 pandemic in the United States. Many of the members of my family are science deniers, even though my mother wasn't. After beginning treatment, I realized that the world really was much crueler than I expected when it came to disclosing my ADHD. While more conservative-leaning individuals tend to deny or underplay the effects of a neurodevelopmental disorder outright, it's also apparent that many left-leaning individuals aren't privy to the conditions as well. America's existing parties are more center-right than anything, and it's not great for any of us. The right is pushing culture war nonsense, and the left is softball on legit issues where the few existing progressives in office propose and fight for change, but corporate democrats bluff at a similar rate to the corporate republicans. \n\nAll of this is to say, I agree with you on the more left-leaning policies being more likely to create meaningful and non-regressive hurdles for the masses, but I think we need to push for having us as people run for the betterment of each other and not the party lines. I understand reasonable assessments in elections, but I really think we need to work on breaking the two-party curse, and run directly within communities that are affected by many different issues, including youth and adults with varying healthcare needs, and bring awareness to the issues that people feel and need insight to on a level of explaining more of the corruption that keeps long-running policymakers in office that don't actually fight for the people. Explaining how our congressional branches are supposed to actually work for us, the people."

I don’t even know how long it would take for my brain chemistry to restore to a pre-treatment state, bc I’ve never been off my meds for more than like 5 consecutive days (those were bad days). Not that anyone should hafta suffer without proper treatment, but the impact on folks who’ve been properly, consistently medicated for decades should be prioritized. I will most definitely hafta go on medical leave if I experience a significant hardship obtaining stimulant medication.\n\nForget about what works best.

Since almost NOBODY has it in stock because it’s so expensive, my doctor suggested I try Vyvanse. My insurance company wouldn’t cover it (which is just absurd since they WILL cover Desoxyn, which is WAY *more* expensive). \n\nAnyways, I did some research and realized that dextroamphetamine ER was an older, long acting pure D-amphetamine medication, like Vyvanse (Vyvanse is the pro-drug of d-amphetamine, and becomes d-amphetamine when you take the pill and metabolize it) but my insurance *does* cover Dextroamphetamine ER, so I asked my doctor about it. who called it in, and it got filled within minutes… Let me tell you, it works *better* than Desoxyn for me, and it’s not even close! Lasts all day and it’s smooth as heck. I did have some physical anxiety on the 10mg my doc called in first.  I told her this and she switched me to 5mg and I gradually moved up to 30mg/day every morning, which seems about right for me. It lasts 10-12 hours consistently. Just perfect, for me at least!"

I fell asleep at my desk working multiple times.\n- intense mouth dryness, I had hard lollies at hand always to combat this\n- paranoia, increased social anxiety. It was really insidious the way this occurred, but I eventually ended up thinking everyone hates me and was truly on the path to becoming a hermit\n- I did not find it helped me with my ADHD much. For the cost ($110 in Australia) I didn't think it was worth it for me. I guess I was less distractable? But honestly after two months I found the results abysmal.\n\nAs someone with a very easy going and extroverted personality I had to stop intuniv due to the paranoia. It got so bad that I had an irrational fear of strangers, to the point it was debilitating. I also found it didn't actually help me fall asleep, I would still stay up late. I've now stopped intuniv and gone back to valdoxan, which is more melatonin based so it helps me fall asleep a lot quicker. \n\nBackground: Im female with ADHD and CPTSD, diagnosed as an adult couple years ago. \n\nHope this helps!"

I’m able to scoop cat shit without feeling like it’s pushing a boulder uphill.. Just random shit that seemed completely impossible before after 5pm— or that I at least couldn’t prioritize over what HAD to be done that day or sitting on my ass at night in a haze. \n\n**My mind is so much quieter.** I can hear my own voice in my head but it’s not racing and it’s not overlapped with my “squirrel!” Voice or the constant music. \n\nTL;DR: It’s def doing something. I haven’t mapped out any long term goals or anything but after just getting by for what feels like —forever… just being in the moment of cleaning out a drawer at 9pm is like “wtf am I doing?? Who am I right now?” I feel like I’m 9 years old again in my head.\n\nEdit / Update: 10 weeks in now. On 2mg. **Still take it in the mornings.** Come 5 am when yesterday’s morning dose is almost out of my system? It’s like a fucking circus in my head that I guess I’ve lived with my entire life and didn’t know wasn’t normal. It’s honestly frightening the difference in what I hear in my mind off this med vs on it. \n\nShort term memory/ **working memory seems to be much better. Less brain fog in general.** But executive functioning is still only somewhat better. Not life changing, setting goals and crushing them etc… I’m making better lists “five thing to do today..” but getting started is still a struggle."

    "comment": "Your dose is probably too high, too low, or your BP is simply too affected. I would encourage you to try to adjust before giving up, because guanfacine is truly one of the only *real* cognitive enhancing medications known - it's effects on the prefrontal cortex and cAMP are absolutely amazing. It's also still a relatively obscure, old school drug and it's not very well known outside of psychiatry.\n\nGuanfacine though is also a very good sympathetic \"noise gate\", due to its a2 effects. It sort of cools off the entire sympathetic nerve trunk bundles. So you're going to feel pretty tired and winded in the beginning. However, it should improve in time. Exercise helps a ton. I have been on it many months with 40mg Adderall. BTW, I didn't see much benefit until I got up to 4mg. I am currently on 5mg/day, and frankly thinking I may even ask to try 6mg. I am 200lb bodybuilding type, and this dose is where I notice it does indeed calm down the nervous system in advantageous ways. Also, I had a profound Improvement in my memory and overall cognition in the 3-4mg range with further improvements at 5mg. The 1-2mg range just made me sleepy."

She did run me through some exercises and questionnaire type stuff as well. She even mentioned specifically that the WAY I talked to her helped her make the diagnosis LOL. She didn't say it in a mean way but I'm sure I was jumping in and not letting her finish sentences, trailing off or hyper fixating, haha.\n\nSo right off the bat she was like let's get you some Adderall! Started on a lower dose and had a Telehealth  follow up 2 weeks later to see how it was going, and over time we figured out the right dose, and any time we changed the dose or if I went a prolonged time without meds for whatever reason and went back she also wanted a 2 week follow up (and I should mention the follow ups were not at an additional charge, they were always just brief video or phone calls to check in and make sure the new dose was working well or if I needed an adjustment, so it wasn't a money grab by any means).\n\nShe has never even mentioned a non stimulant. I get the impression that she sees that this is what works the majority of the time, and isn't afraid of being accused of being a pill pusher because she's confident in her understanding of adhd and her thorough treatment of her patients, so there's really no reason to mess around."

Vyvanse especially can’t really be pulled apart and used as a street drug so docs seem pretty fine with it. \n\nI imagine it helped that I could say I’d taken this medicine and it worked? But my husband was diagnosed as an adult (though he’s not keen on meds necessarily— only takes them as needed), and they did have him try Ritalin first but switched to Vyvanse after it didn’t work, within a few weeks.

    "comment": "My doctor wasn’t allowed to prescribe me what she wanted to. First she had to try multiple non-stimulant medications. Once those didn’t work we were allowed to try Adderall but only had a specific very low dosage. After that I was able to ramp up to full Adderall dosage. After a while that and not being thrilled with results, I wanted to switch to Vyvanse and she was fine with this. Unfortunately, as with the attempt to get me onto a stimulant in the first place insurance company wouldn’t let her. I had to go try two other medications first. Unfortunately nobody could actually buy the first of those two and none of the insurance companies processes accounted for the idea that you might not actually be able to buy a drug. So I was just stuck with no medication because my prescription had been changed to the new thing I couldn’t buy. Eventually, I gave up and went back to Adderall.\n\nWhile it is true that some doctors do have their heads up their butts with regards to stimulant medication, in the United States the more likely explanation is that they have no choice in the matter. If they do not make you jump through the hoops that the insurance company has set up then the only way for you to get the drug they want to give you is to pay for it yourself with no help from insurance"

She said, “doing these kinds of test show me how your body will break down certain medications and how your body will react to the chemicals.” I don’t know the validity in it, but I’m glad she did. She’s argued against certain medications because they won’t work well with me. And she was right. The few meds I wanted to try that she wasn’t a huge fan of, didn’t work for me. I don’t know the science behind any of it—but when she gets going on chemical reactions and scientific breakdown…man, I don’t I’ve ever seen someone so excited at their job. It’s great.\n\nMeds have always been difficult for me. I have a fairly low tolerance for medication, so when the side effects hit, *they hit.*\n\n Currently on 27MG methylphenidate and things seem to be going well. But prior to that…we tried a bunch of cocktails to handle anxiety, depression, BPD, and night terrors. It took a while. And to be completely honest, I’m not that mad about it. We discussed how stimulants may boost the effects of my other issues. And because of my low tolerance for meds, she was a little concerned about adding extra stimulants to my med plan.\n\nI was getting tired of all the trials and I asked if we could just focus on the ADD. We talked things over and I said, “I feel like the anxiety and depression are coming from the ADD.” I’m now only on meds for BPD and ADD. \n\nIt took a while—and it sucked—but I’m glad I didn’t just jump into things.

    "comment": ">Most people agree that stimulants simply work way better, hence the reason why they are SUPPOSED to be used as a 1st line treatment. Unfortunately however most doctors still want you to try non stimulant meds like Strattera or intuniv before you can get to the thing that actually helps.\n\nThe statement that \"stimulants simply work way better\" is not really true.\n\nAll drugs are not created equal, and research has indicated that Strattera has the same level of efficacy as methylphenidate-based medications like Concerta, Ritalin and Focalin and has a similar level of side effects as well. It isn't an inferior treatment. Strattera *is* considered a first-line treatment for ADHD. It's also easier to get because it isn't a controlled substance. It certainly doesn't work for everyone, though, and I can appreciate having been on it personally that it is *deeply unsatisfying* to the ADHD brain. I did see significant therapeutic results in the three months I was taking it, but it is a bit of a waiting game and there is a lot of gaslighting yourself about if it's even working at all. I only stopped because of how it was affecting my sleep. The lack of an immediate, clear response is kind of the opposite of what our brains want even if the drug *does actually work in a measurable way* for a lot of the people who take it.\n\nIntuniv is not a first-line treatment, and I really haven't heard of too many people who are taking it who didn't have problems on stimulants.\n\n>Mine currently has me on 80mg of Strattera for a month and it's not only been unaffective, it makes me feel terrible! I'm hoping at my next appointment they will let me try something like Concerta at least and in the meantime I'm wondering what kind of hoops and how many of these kinds of meds (and for how long) did you guys have to get through before finally getting relief with a stimulant?\n\nI'm sorry that Strattera is not working for you. No med works for everyone, and in your medication journey you will likely find multiple meds that clearly *don't* work, and several that have various levels and forms of working.\n\nPersonally, I was offered stimulants to start with, but declined because I wanted to try Strattera first. I'm currently taking Wellbutrin, which I think is working well enough at the moment, although the subject of trying a stimulant comes up every time I see my psychiatrist. She is wearing me down on the subject."

So it’s a controlled drug that I have to show ID for, but the system recognises that studies have shown somewhere from 50-80% of adhd patients benefit from a psychostimulant. It’s insane that your practitioner has ignored those numbers and not gone straight to something like methylphenidate.

Didn’t want to eat or sleep. \n\n\nAdderall (3-4 years)- marginally better than Ritalin, fewer personality changes. Still didn’t want to eat, sleep was a bit better. \n\n\nFocalin (6-8ish years) - Best of the first 3 that I tried. Eventually stopped in college, took a sleep aid, grades improved. \n\n\nStraterra (1 year) - still had full appetite and ability to sleep. Caused extreme heartburn if I took without food. \n\n\nVyvanse (literally 2 days) - have been able to eat but not necessarily  hungry. Sleep so far hasn’t been great but may improve. \n\n\nThose are just my experiences. Also the years may not match up, I just guessed at them. I took a break for about 4 years between Focalin and Straterra."

    "comment": "I've been offered non stimulant because stimulant meds were the only thing available but they made me feel absolutely horrible. Super frustrating as stimulant meds are basically the only thing readily available here in the UK.\n\nI had the worst experience ever, no emotion, no personality, shaking and cold sweats, my head went so quiet I couldn't even muster up a single thought. I lost all sense of self and if anything felt more anxious. I was able to approach any task without any internal debate. But then I didn't feel involved in said task whatsoever. Whether that was ar work or doing my hobbies like playing guitar. I had no issues doing any of these like I maybe would've before, but now I just didn't get any sense of stimulation from anything...\n\nIve had to wait 7 months for non stimulants to become available, chasing week after week to adhd professionals who take 3 weeks to send a basic letter or to reply to an email or answer the phone. Absolutely shocking how they dealt with me start to finish. But now the non stimulants are available, in the meantime I've managed to sort out my financial situation and work a deal with my workplace where I'm working less hours, which is allowing me more time for myself and I'm also getting a disability benefit payment every month because of how badly my adhd effects me. \n\nBoth of these things together have helped massively in regulating my symptoms a little better. One thing ive always found, is if my finances are bad, every aspect of my life and my adhd gets worse. But, If I'm not forever worried about going down to my last £5 every single month like I have for several years in a row then in general I am much better. I still struggle and forget and misplace all the same, but it doesn't bother me as much and I'm able to just live a more carefree adhd life. I always picture myself taking the perfect meds and working a full time job etc. But I think I'd ultimately still be more depressed, because I hate not having my own time, just being able to go to work for longer hours and have less time for myself doesn't sound like something I want to strive to achieve. I want to be able to work to pay my bills, and then have plenty of time for myself. \n\nI've worked 40-50hr weeks for the last 12 years since I was 15. I never felt so depressed as I did the last 6 years because I held a job maximum 5 months. But now for 1.5 years I've done 3/4 days a week, got a disability benefit to help (because adhd is a disability) and I've actually kept the job the entire time, no problems with time or wanting to quit or doing dumb shit that gets me fired. And I get a whole extra day or two a week to myself, and I've never felt better.\n\nSorry for long essay! Just like to give my perspective on meds and what I've done to put myself in a better situation. Personally I think meds do help, but they only really serve to make you fit the mould of society, instead of making everything easier for you, it makes you easier for everything else so that you can do normal work weeks, work careers like everyone else etc. It's great if that's what you want to do. But unfortunately these days society tells you you have to be successful and earn loads of money and have a career to be happy. Which is just absolutely not the case. You need friends, you need your own time, and you need freedom from the norms to just be a human. Life has no meaning, don't waste the entirety of it striving for one thing and one thing only, just enjoy it, and the fact your existence is such a rare but complex thing. Take the time at any age to spend more time enjoying things and not devoting all your effort in one place. Learn, develop and change your situation. As much as it's annoying changing jobs all the time, and it's not as secure, one fantastic thing that's coem from it for me is my knowledge and experience. I love learning and I will forever look for new things to learn!!\n\nTl;Dr My response about non stimulant meds and a following tangent on an aspect of my life where I took meds and what I've done instead, and my outlook on life since."

    "comment": "Pretty much my experience. I went to what I was told was the ONE doctor in my city who treats ADHD adults. He insisted on putting me on Nortriptylin which is not even recognised or mentioned anywhere at all as an ADHD treatment :/ it's a tricyclic antidepressant, given at a low dose. Usually used for chronic pain, but even that not very often.\n\nHowever, he sounded knowledgeable and he explained that it would boost noradrenaline (norepenephrine) levels, which help with the executive functioning side of ADHD. Since I am more inattentive and don't have many struggles with impulsive behaviour, this all made sense.\n\nIt seemed to help a little, which in hindsight, I wonder if this was just a placebo effect. However there was a very long period of adjustment, which made me feel tired and nauseous. I ran out by mistake and I could not face going through the adjustment again. I had at this point looked up what the guidelines were in my country and found that Strattera was approved for adults, and it apparently had the same, noradrenaline-boosting effect. So I asked my doctor about it and he was very dismissive, according to him, Strattera was no good, far too many side effects and less effective, Nortriptylin was much better and would have previously been approved but some red tape had prevented it.\n\nOK. So then I said couldn't I try a stimulant medication, Elvanse had recently been approved, and again, he said no, Elvanse will be no good for you, too strong side effects, it's only good for people who get aggressive and in trouble with the police (!) He did then \"let\" me try methylphenidate but in a very strange procedure, he basically sold me 5x 10mg instant release pills from a drawer in his desk and then asked me to try taking 10mg, 15mg, and 20mg on different days and then whichever of those doses was the best, I was to come back and repeat that dose on a day that I took a computer test.\n\nI had at this point heard about how titration is usually done and that they normally prescribe a dose which you take over several days/weeks and live your normal life. I asked if I couldn't do this and he said no, the computer test is more objective. I thought this was stupid because there were too many other factors affecting my performance on a test, and I didn't care about how I did on a test anywhere near as much as how it affects me IRL.\n\nAnyway I got frustrated with this and started to seek a new doctor. It took me a couple of years to find one. I am now with the new doctor and they immediately went to stimulants, with a proper titration process. When I said I had been on Nortriptylin previously, they said \"Yeah he puts everyone on that.\" My original doctor retired, so at least he can't bullshit anyone with crappy non-treatment any more, I guess? Considering so many of you said yours died, I wonder if this is a generational thing."

And what does he do? Insists that I try stimulant meds first, bc they are first-line and yadda yadda. So I give it a go with Focalin. Unsurprising, hate how fast and hard my heart is going, and feel like I'm going to DIE. Heightened anxiety and irritability and saying regrettable things at work before thinking. I tried for 4 months hoping it would improve, but it hardly did. Finally he lets me get off of it, and then we try something else that still wasn't a non-stimulant.\n\nAnd what am I on now that I just love?? **Strattera** :D along with Wellbutrin, which I was already a fan of for depression.

He actually spent time figuring out what her main concerns are (hint: the attention part is not her biggest problem) and figured a stimulant could possibly lead to undesired side effects, so went with a new non stimulant med, Atenta (not sure the name in English). She had excellent results with the minimum dosage, and is thriving now with adjusted dosage.!<\n\n>!On the other hand, as soon as I mentioned my main problem was on the attention side, I immediately got my Vyvanse prescription, with very good results (need to amp the dose next appointment), BECAUSE HE WAS LISTENING.

I got tested and was diagnosed and then was prescribed multiple non stim meds, like Strattera & Wellbutrin.  When I moved and got a new Dr, I had to go through MORE tests even though I had the ADHD test results from the previous hospital. Still got prescribed non stims and it took almost 2 years before I was prescribed Adderall .  I was driving almost 2 hours to get to that clinic.  My doctor then took another job so I had to get another Dr and I chose a closer clinic but spent over a year with them ( they specialized in ADHD)  and was never given any stimulants. They wanted me to take MORE tests to prove I had ADHD. I finally dropped them and went back to my old clinic and I have to drive a quite a bit to get there. But now I'm starting all over, even tho I was prescribed Adderall AT THE SAME CLINIC,  I was being started with a low dose of Concerta, which did barely anything and am now FINALLY getting 10 mg Adderall.  I live in a state that is known for it's excellent medical care but being diagnosed with ADHD as an adult and getting treatment has been an absolute nightmare."

    "comment": "I would be hesitant to try Strattera unless stimulants *didn’t* work - it can have serious gastro side effects and cause headaches (did both for me) and there’s at least anecdotal (if not actual peer reviewed) evidence that Strattera is one of those weird drugs where you can stop taking it but the negative side effects (sleep issues, nightmares, headaches, gastro stuff, etc) can stick around. In my book, there’s not enough evidence that Strattera is going to be more effective for most of the adhd population than stimulants - it can work for some, but it’s usually only used when stimulants can’t be used for some reason (local laws or rules for your job, stimulant intolerance, etc). \n\nI’d be far more willing to trial intuniv or that nonstimulant adhd med that recently got reapproved in the US  a few years back (not a new drug, but all I recall is they use it in France lol - quelbree? Aka viloxazine) over Strattera. I’d even be willing to try Wellbutrin before Strattera - you still have to ramp up and down slowly, but at least the potential side effects could include being really horny and losing weight instead of being miserably ill. \n\nI’ve tried almost everything: Strattera (on top of and separately from stimulants), intuniv (on top of and separate from stimulants), Wellbutrin (ALSO on top of stimulants as well as on its own and I’ve never been been bitchier or closer to a healthy weight lol thanks adhd binge eating, adderall (alone and with antidepressants and gabapentin for anxiety), Ritalin and all it’s derivatives, and many antidepressants (celexa, Zoloft, Prozac…. I forget the others, it was over a decade ago). I also take trileptol, a mood stabilizer I was put on because my mom is bipolar and the drs were just throwing pills at me to see what would help - honestly not sure if that helps or hinders me, but I’ve been on it for 6 years and every time I taper down it’s hell, so I’ve been sitting at a low dose for years. Haven’t tried vyvanse or dexedrines. \n\nBut I originally was going to the psych drs for depression and anxiety, then I got unofficially diagnosed with adhd (which I’d suspected in high school but my mom freaked the fuck out so thoroughly I never brought it up again after the dr handed me a trial of Ritalin and my mom snatched it away), then a decade later I decided maybe I should be sure, got tested, and yup I’m adhd (and maybe ASD but the adhd means that testing won’t ever officially happen). I’d been off adderall for most of that time, trialling antidepressants and anti anxiety meds, which is how I ended up on Wellbutrin. Then the slow slog of finding a decent stimulant began while I also tried intuniv and Strattera because I was desperate and the stimulants weren’t helping enough, but the intuniv did little to nothing (maybe made my temper slower to react? But I could attribute that to the mood stabilizers) and the strattera hurt a lot more than it help - I was never able to tolerate it well enough to function on it to SEE if it helped, I took it for 2-3 months and my already awful GI issues skyrocketed and my head always hurt.\n\nNow I take focalin, a Ritalin derivative. It’s not ideal, but I haven’t found something better and my dr doesn’t want to try out new meds when there’s a shortage…. Which is idiotic, because we both know there is no end in sight to that shortage. I honestly think my dr was just like “fuck it, she isn’t actively suicidal every day, and she’s not manic or violently ill from the stimulants, so let’s just leave it the hell alone”. And my adhd says “yeah I’ll get right on handling all the healthcare navigation it would require to change your meds - NOT!!!!”"

My sense is that this leads to many ADHDers *thinking* that they don't work or that they are far less effective than stimulant medications.\n\nNo med works for everyone, and your brain's medication needs are unique, but if you haven't tried Strattera you should consider discussing it with your provider. It does work for some people, and research has suggested it's about as effective as methylphenidate after two months of treatment.\n\nPersonally, I was on Strattera for 3 months and only stopped due to how it was affecting my sleep. I *did* see significant therapeutic improvement while I was on it. Strattera is, in terms of ADHD meds, just another option. I think it's profoundly unhelpful the way some people who have never tried it or for whom it didn't work paint it like it's some kind of fake or lesser medication because it isn't a stimulant."

I should elaborate more, they said stimulants can make everything worse if your anxiety and depression is untreated. Makes me so mad though because the first person I went to said adhd can cause anxiety and depression so sometimes if you fix the adhd then you will fix the anxiety and depressions. This has been confirmed by many people also. I have found that the other psychiatrist hate when you say that and tell me that’s wrong and that it’s “Comorbid”. It’s beyond frustrating!

Turns out I'm a poor 2D6 metabolizer, before we knew this (I think my doc had a hunch though) she tried me on 18mg Strattera. A starter dose for a kid, and I'm a 6'1 220lb dude. And it absolutely kicked my ass. If I stood up, I fell down. Dropped my BP through the floor and I otherwise felt like absolute dog**** the entire time. My liver wasn't metabolizing it since it's a 2D6 substrate, and it therefore just kept building up in my system to the point that I basically severely overdosed on 1/5 the dose I'd normally be on. Doc gets a trophy for seeing that coming! (I'd previously taken Abilify and Lexapro and they both had really severe side effects at relatively low doses, and they're both 2D6 substrates, and she put 2+2 together and got 2D6) Anyways since I got off the Strattera I've been a bloody wreck. Depression is way worse than it was. I had no idea that that particular gift keeps on giving. So thank you for that info!\n\nSquirrel moment, a couple dice as a tattoo would be a neat homage to this mess. Roll 2D6 for attention...snake eyes. I gotta get one of Scrat first tho!"

We're a lot of different folks playing percentage games, and sometimes you're part of the percent it works for, and sometimes you're not.\n\nThis works for most of us so we try it first.

    "comment": "I responded but got automodded, did some research, and have new opinions now. I'm not here to win an argument, just to discuss & learn.\n\nAccurate diagnoses may be manipulated either consciously or subconsciously by those seeking help for their symptoms. I don't say this with the implication of drug-seeking behavior so much as recognition for the desperation that drives one to seek to medicate discomfort. A godly physician may be able to easily tell the difference between depression, ADHD, anxiety, stress, and whatever other mechanisms can cause one to present symptoms of ADHD, but most physicians are people. Everyone socially masks themselves to some extent & some symptoms may be more apparent than others.\n\nBeing somewhat familiar with the mechanism of some stimulants and not at all with with many other kinds of medications, my perspective is that stims have broad systemic effects that may result in permanent physiological changes depending on dosage & length of treatment. Other medications, such as second/third line ADHD meds and those used to treat differentials, are more focused in their mechanism of action and have a more plastic effect on the patient. Another thing to consider is that stims can be used to effectively treat other disorders that may be better served by a different medication - this road goes both ways.\n\nSome day we'll have more effective means for diagnosing and treating mental health disorders but for now we're stuck with making educated guesses and experimenting. \n\nI understand the merit of stim-first, but I think the frustration it takes to get stims the longer way may be worth it in some cases."

Our understanding of neurocognition is constantly developing and psychiatry, like all sciences besides pop music, is imperfect.\n\nMentioned in the above article is the merit of psychosocial factors/behavior modification (ie coping mechanisms) in conjunction with medication, which over time will result in neurological changes that could eventually provide a basis for reassessment. We know that brains literally work differently as we age, especially in regards to a handful of disorders. We'll learn more as time goes on, but I think it's fair to say that, \"fundamental changes in the brain don't get corrected,\" is a very wide blanket over a problem we don't thoroughly understand enough yet."

I find for me at least it helps with the focus and attention but not the executive functioning and motivation etc. That said I'm pretty sure it's dosed on weight and I should be up to 80 or 100mg but my treatment team are taking it slow due to me more than likely having bipolar (diagnosis is now questioned because of ADHD diagnosis and the overlap between the two but I'm pretty sure I have it)\n\nI feel I will need a higher dose and possibly even more that one non stimulant at a time to get me moving. I have always struggled with executive function, motivation issues etc. since childhood and also suffer from debilitating depression, anhedonia (lack of pleasure) and so on. I am on Abilify for my bipolar but also because it is meant to be 'activating' and stimulating - the highest dose possible doesn't even get me moving and into gear.\n\nThat said I tolerate Strattera well. When I first started it I was quite hungry for 11 days of pure overeating but that stopped, most people say it kills their appetite. I had trouble sleeping for about two weeks - either getting to sleep or staying asleep, I would wake up at multiple points throughout the night or early morning and be unable to sleep again for some time. That's all stopped now and sleep and appetite are back to normal. \n\nI do tend to be hot or sweat a lot more than usual, and have more problems than I normally do with erectile dysfunction, however I am on a lot of psychiatric medicines as well as the Strattera including multiple antidepressants, antipsychotics, lithium etc. etc. No problem with sex drive though in fact have noticed an increase which I'm not mad about. \n\nI'm liking Strattera more than other medicines I have been on for ADHD which are Vyvanse and Dexamphetamine (stimulants) and Clonidine (non stimulant). I notice the benefits over a longer period of time - say I forget a days dose, I'll still have more focus and attention than I would with missing a stimulant dose which would give me no benefit. Because of that the effect also lasts all day instead of wearing off after 10-12+ hours leaving you with a nasty crash at the end of the day."

    "comment": "**Psychiatric nurse with ADHD here!\n\nThere are a couple things I’ve found while taking stimulants in particular. \n\n1) stimulants like vyvanse will be less effective for people with slower metabolisms. It requires your body to digest the drug for it to actually be turned into the stimulant part, and then it has limited time to absorb before it gets expelled from your colon. If you're overweight or have poor metabolism, it's going to affect how that works. \n\n2) vitamin c enhances how fast vyvanse and Adderall are absorbed by the body and 'used up' so to speak. If you take your stimulant and a multivitamin at the same time, you could be cutting your dose of stimulant in half without realizing it. Alternatively you can use vitamin c to prepare for bed by taking a supplement when you need to start getting sleepy to kind of force the stimulant out of your system. \n\n3) vyvanse is extended release, but it is also water soluble. If you were inclined you could dissolve your daily dose in water and meter it out to yourself that way. Just be careful that you don't overdose. \n\n-----\n\nI've taken pretty much every medicine for adhd and found that I like being unmedicated better in the course of my life, because medication kept me from maintaining any coping skills that I had from before. I found myself in the position of having to come off of my medication because I had no money, and it destroyed me for a while because I didn't know how to live anymore. \n\nNot saying it happens that way for everyone -- but I don't want to rely on that to keep me from the deep end. I need to find that ability in myself and build better habits. \n\nHope any of this helps someone here. ❤️"

It's an atypical stimulant which means it doesn't directly stimulate the central nervous system, rather it does so gradually and indirectly. It's not a vasoconstrictor, which can also create the jittery anxiety effects. It's an adaptogen which can have anxiolytic effects. It doesn't have strong appetite suppression effects like classic stims but ymmv, it may even increase it if your metabolism is affected by the adaptogenic effects. It's used for improving athletic performance as well as increasing focus and attention as a bonus. Oh and you only take it once as it lasts the whole day.\n\nI've heard of people using it off label for adhd but where, I can't recall."

    "comment": "OP, you listing shaky as a side effect made me wonder something, have all the meds you've tried been extended release versions? I ask because while the majority of people metabolize drugs at the same rate, there are people who metabolize medications quicker and people who metabolize medications slower too, and being a person who is outside the norm in either direction can cause big problems with dosages.\n\nI, for example, metabolize drugs quickly. I had the worst headaches of my life and my blood pressure shot up worryingly high (I'm not sure how high, but 9 hours later it was registering as 180/80, and typical for me is 123/68) taking Clartin-D, which means my body reacted like I'd take a few doses of Sudafed at once. So to avoid that issue, I take regular Claritin and Sudafed separately, so I'm not getting more than one decongestant dose at a time. I can't take Ambien, either, and had worse side effects, with hallucinations and vomiting.\n\nAnyway, the TLDR is if you always took the extended versions or always the shorter acting versions, it might be worth trying the other formula before giving up on meds altogether. Especially if you have had problems with other drugs not working as intended too."

I have dual diagnosis’ of MDD and treatment resistant depression, as well as PTSD and GAD, in addition to ADHD (combined type). \n\n***HOWEVER***do be warned that any allergic reactions/intolerance of bupropion often are delayed in onset, occurring anywhere from the end of week 1 to weeks 3 and 4. (Rather than an immediate reaction to primary exposure.) I was unfortunate enough to have this experience myself, though was unaware it was even happening until I was already in an anaphylactic state. Side note: I have SEVERE eczema and psoriasis as is, so I assumed that the full body rash and itchiness I was experiencing during the first few days (and initial outbreak symptoms) was just from one or the other (or both lol), so I went about life as usual and continued taking the medication for the next 2-3 weeks. My ignorance truly was bliss. My mental health drastically improved over such a short period of time and I felt so incredibly hopeful for its longevity and stability to maintain this as a baseline mentality. My ADHD was manageable *and* I still had a personality!! My depression was in check and my anxiety had decreased significantly. I felt like myself again.\n\nThough soon broke out into full body hives and became anaphylactic within 48 hours. \n\nI have no prior history of allergies to any medications and thus hadn’t even considered it as a possibility. \n\n(Nor did the doctor that prescribed it either.

So I am intermittently medicated and quite upset.   \n  \nIm on 40 mg of Vyvanse and its the only medication that has ever had any effect on me. Well adderall made me pretty anxious. But besides that everything else did basically nothing. Even Vyvanse is barely noticeable and not nearly enough to significantly improve my quality of life. But it's still the best I've gotten so far.  \n  \nI find it intensely frustrating because I don't know what to do next. \n\nIt feels like when unmedicated I am completely broken and nonfunctional. Small things like laundry or showering or cleaning up my space or doing homework or paperwork or reaching out to people I need to contact or checking my email (things I can start and make significant progress on on a whim mostly) are all basically not gonna happen. Like they just don't happen because there's no set deadline to make me anxious so I just can't do them. I've been looking for ways to make myself for literally my entire life and I haven't found them. \n\nIf something is bigger (more important) and has a deadline I do it at the last minute. It's very stressful which is why it works, but stress hurts. And isn't good for you. And because thats the only way to get stuff like that done I get completely burnt out over time. So again I have been trying to find a way to start before the last minute and just never ever found anything my whole life. I went to a therapist to ask for advice and when they asked what I had tried and I listed the things I had tried they didn't have anything else to add. \n\nWhen on vyvanse I am much less stressed in general, and I can randomly do those smaller tasks. Its better than not at all but I hate that it's random. My chance of randomly feeling like doing stuff and then actually managing to goes way up but I wish it was at will, like how a brain is supposed to work. \n\nI also have a harder time getting stressed enough to do bigger assignments. \n\nI don't know what \"\"working\"\" is supposed to feel like. Should I expect more? Is this as good as it gets? I know you need to try to do the work on top of just being medicated but I have been trying so many things for so long and none of it worked. None of it even really helped. How do I judge what is actually gonna change anything. \n\nI feel like it works for 6 hours of a day if that. I have found nothing about the organization of a day which helps me get more out of it. My doctor said that amount of time was normal."

But I realized that once I hit the burnout part of the semester I lose the ability to be motivated by stress. But my only coping mechanism to ever do anything is waiting till the last minute, so I end up staying up obscenely late every night waiting for motivation.   \n  \nAnd then have intense protracted mental and physical decline until I don't even submit multiple finals. So I don't think I'm lazy.  \n  \nI can't shower regularly. I have never been able to shower regularly. When I was younger I didn't realize people actually managed to shower every day. I feel disgusting and I always have, but nothing changes no matter how terrible I feel. \n\nWhat do I even do."

It’s unfortunate that it was a negative experience for you, but I suppose I was just trying to highlight that they exist and are a good fit for many in OPs position, although like most medications that act on neurotransmitters, it’s kind of hard to predict what will be helpful, what will be harmful, and what will have no effect"

As I mentioned in another comment, the last medicine I was offered sent me into a very deep depression. It was definitely the medicine too, cause I felt better the day I stopped taking it. One of the worst experiences of my life.\n\nI’m not sure what to say about coping. I’ve done a lot of therapy over the last 5 years and have come to accept my adhd quirks. It’s amazing just how much easier life gets when I don’t blame myself for making mistakes, dealing with executive dysfunction or just needing a break. \n\nLife is still hard, mind you.

The doctor does not think the med could be the cause. He did up the dose after a month, but the tics got much worse, so it was dropped back to 1 mg. \n\n35 years ago he was put on Haldol for TS, which sent him into a deep depression. A different doctor denied that Haldol could be causing it, but another confirmed it was a known - but rare - side effect, so he went off it."

The blunting seemed to go away for me. \n\nI haven't seen any positive secondary effects, but I think it can reduce anxiety in people. \n\nI take Intuniv every day. On days when I take a stimulant (methylphenidate), I generally take it after my second dose. On days when I don't take a stimulant, I generally wake up, have coffee and take Intuniv after the coffee wakes me up. \n\nOnce the Intuniv kicks in I get off the couch, put the dishes away, cook breakfast and clean the dishes. It really helps me when I don't take a stimulant. \n\nI've been able to reduce my Ritalin dose from 20mg three times a day to 15mg three times a day. It's helped me a good deal"

What you're describing seems a lot like what I'm experiencing. I feel like I've been forgetting what I'm doing more often than usual, setting things down in places and then forgetting to get them, etc. The other day I ruined a pan because I forgot to turn off the burner, which I've never done before in my life.\n\n\nAs far as alternative non-stimulants go, I started on Strattera, which actually worked really well for me immediately (I was told it would take about a month for me to see effects?), but a few days in my heart rate was getting super high, like around 120 resting, so even though I felt amazing mentally the whole time I stopped taking it within a week. My hunch is that I'm sensitive to it and my starting dose was too high because that's not a typical reaction. That said if it weren't for the racing heartbeat I would have stuck with it.\n\n\nMy question for you is was Intuniv helpful for you at 2mg? I've been wondering if the reason for the memory issues has to do with my dose being low."
