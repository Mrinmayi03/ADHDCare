Just remember to give yourself time, accept that you won't feel good for \\~3 weeks, and try to focus on the areas of your life that the drug is helping. I saw some minor progress in my ADHD symptoms in just 5 days. Concentrating on how much better I felt being able to remember conversations and focus really helped me overlook the dizziness and insomnia and drowsiness. The suffering is temporary, but the positive effects have been permanent :)"

    "comment": "Yes, I find that it does. I'm less scattered, for sure. However, this drug doesn't change the brain you have. I find that my memory works better mostly because I'm less disorganized overall and because I can focus better now. So now, I'm actually *making memories* where before, I wasn't really paying attention. Like, I don't suddenly have skills or talents that weren't there before. I'm just a better version of me. Qelbree lets me do all the things I knew I was capable of doing before but that my ADHD just wouldn't let me do. \n\nThe difference is subtle. It's hard to quantify the changes because Qelbree isn't on an on/off switch like stimulants are. \n\nTo specifically answer your question, though, I don't feel like I'm a better storyteller now. I've always been a bad storyteller lol. I still ramble. However, I don't forget my train of thought as much anymore. Also, I am better about staying on topic during a conversation, and I don't get derailed as easily."

And, it's obliterated my appetite- I've lost 15 lbs since I started taking it (which I'm not complaining about; I am about 50 lbs overweight as it is). It took about 5 days to realize that it was working for me- more focus and drive to complete tasks, actually being able to multi-task effectively.

The nausea and dizziness are gone for me, I'm starting to notice I can follow through on tasks I start more. One thing I will say, my girlfriend and I like to go out to do karaoke or play pool or stuff, and I usually have a couple beers. MY psychiatrist said it wouldn't be a big deal as long as I don't go overboard but I don't think I can do it anymore. Halfway through a second beer, about when I'd start feeling any actual effects from alcohol I now get insanely drowsy, like 'can we please leave immediately' drowsy, and by the time we get home I strip down and my girlfriend says I'm snoring in under a minute. I'm a pretty light sleeper and she said she had to literally grab my arm and roll me all the way over for room to sleep and I never woke up.\n\nSo now I think drinking might be a 'glass of wine at home while watching a movie' sort of thing because doing it away from bed didn't work out the couple times I tried it."

    "comment": "I want to first acknowledge that I've seen the ads and they piss me off. There's enough stigma around ADHD as it is without a drug manufacturer adding to it. \n\nThat said, \"stimulants\" are not a monolith, nor are \"non-stimulants\" a monolith. Amphetamine (Adderall, Vyvanse) is not the same as methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta, Focalin), and some non-stimulants, notably atomoxetine (Strattera) and, yes, viloxazine (Qelbree) are considered first-line treatments as well.\n\nClinical data has generally indicated that atomoxetine and methylphenidate have comparable therapeutic efficacy, with amphetamine compounds outperforming both slightly. There's limited head-to-head research on viloxazine because it's relatively new, but if it was inferior to atomoxetine they probably wouldn't be marketing it. Other non-stimulants like the alpha-blockers guanfacine (Intuniv) and clonidine (Catapres) and bupropion (Wellbutrin) are generally considered second-line treatments.\n\nProviders should educate their ADHD patients on each of the options, the pros and cons of each (including both stimulants and non-stimulants) and help their patient make the right decision about how to medicate their ADHD if medication is something that the patient wants to do. Denying or downplaying the efficacy of non-stimulants is really not helpful. They do work for many people, and while stimulant medications certainly should not be as tightly controlled as they are, there is an undeniable convenience to being able to just fill your prescription like any other medication that is appealing to many people even beyond the therapeutic benefits."

I take my stimulant only when I really need it.

    "comment": "Your perspective provides a nuanced view of ADHD treatment options, emphasizing the diversity within stimulant and non-stimulant medications. It's crucial to recognize that each medication type has distinct mechanisms and potential benefits, catering to individual patient needs. Educating patients about these options, including their efficacy, side effects, and practical considerations, empowers them to make informed decisions about their treatment. While stimulants may offer convenience and proven effectiveness for many, non-stimulants like atomoxetine and viloxazine also play significant roles, often as first-line treatments. By acknowledging and discussing the full range of medication choices, healthcare providers can better support ADHD patients in finding the most suitable and effective treatment approach for their unique circumstances."

I hate never knowing if I‚Äôm going to find my meds out of stock in a given month and be forced to take unplanned breaks from them and feel like complete shit the entire time with zero control of it.

I was on such a high dose that my body finally gave in and I had a panic attack and was sent to the hospital. After that, no more stims. I‚Äôm trying bupropion right now but it isn‚Äôt working so well.

I don‚Äôt feel bouts of depression coming on as often, and if they do they are over pretty quickly and are not as deep. I‚Äôm also not waking up at odd hours with racing thoughts of all the bad things in my life that I could‚Äôve done differently, which I‚Äôm very happy about. \n\nIf I feel myself start to think in that direction at any point (which was something I experienced often at any time of the day or night) I can tell myself to stop and I stop. Shocking and amazing.\n\nMotivation and follow through? I‚Äôm not there yet. 400 to 600 mg of caffeine in pill form would get me more motivated than Wellbutrin. Unfortunately I had to stop taking any caffeine pills (which I took for many years) because of high BP issues. I tried 100mg recently and my BP shot up way too high for comfort. Felt amazing after the long break plus combined with the Wellbutrin, though. \n\nMay I ask how much are you taking, is it generic, how else do you feel it‚Äôs helped you?"

I added the small Adderall dose because I was still having issues sticking with tasks and it's helped with that a ton.

My doctor said that was common and to just let her know if it gets out of hand and we can try other meds, but so far it hasn't been a deal breaker. I have started cutting back heavily on my caffeine intake and that has helped a ton for this. Who'd have guessed that waking up and immediately having wellbutrin, amphetamine, caffeine, and nicotine would make someone feel overstimulated and uncomfortable? \n\nI'm not a doctor or an expert but I think the combo of wellbutrin and adderall can do that. I guess the wellbutrin is a reuptake inhibitor for norepinephrine, so adding adderall (or maybe any other stim?) can sometimes do that to people since norepinephrine is used by the brain for stress regulation in addition to attention and whatnot."

    "comment": "I personally did not react well to Qelbree, but I had to try both Strattera and Qelbree before I could give any stimulants a shot as I already take a controlled substance. If I recall, Qelbree was ever so slightly better than Strattera, but both gave me side effects with no benefit. That said, there are a lot of options for non stimulant ADHD medication, I just couldn't try them as I naturally have very low blood pressure, and most of the others tend to lower blood pressure.\n\nIn addition to the non stimulant ADHD medications that can lower blood pressure, I know 2 people who have had success with SSRIs or SNRIs. I myself have tried quite a few of them for other reasons before my ADHD diagnosis. In my case, after begging my doctors to stop trying SSRIs, one finally listened and had some blood work done. Turns of a literally don't metabolize them properly, which, though somewhat rare, explained a lot.\n\nI recommend giving Qelbree a shot, but don't wait months for side effects to \"even out\" if it isn't working. Keep meticulous notes on how you are feeling, any side effects(whether they seem relevant or not, write them down. You never know), and any benefits. Report anything intolerable to your doctor immediately and anything else after 2 weeks. If you and your doctor decide to give it another week or 2, repeat the same process.\n\nDo you have a history of heart problems or any underlying conditions contributing to the palpitations, or has that been an isolated reaction to wellbutrin?\n\nPlease only answer if you feel comfortable doing so, no pressure."

    "comment": "That's awesome! Chances are you won't need to worry about palpitations with any other medications, even if you do eventually try a stimulant.\n\nI still think trying your non stimulant options first is a good idea, especially if the idea of stimulants gives you anxiety. That said, there are plenty of stimulant options besides adderall. Despite knowing that people with ADHD generally react differently to stimulants than those without ADHD, I was anxious about trying them for two reasons.\n\n1. I wasn't 100% certain I had ADHD. I grew up under unique circumstances that made answering the typical ADHD questionnaire extremely complicated. Very few yes or no questions were as simple as yes or no. I adapted to avoid consequences, so questions like, \"Do you often misplace things?\" Required a lengthy explanation of why the answer was 'no, never' due to learned hyper awareness. So many of my symptoms were masked by survival tactics.\n\n2. I have suffered aggressive anxiety and the idea of trying stimulants, which often insight panic in those with anxiety who don't have ADHD was terrifying.\n\nThat said, my imposter syndrome disappeared after the first day I tried stimulants. I wasn't anxious or on edge, I was calm and actually spent hours struggling to keep my eyes open(only the first day or two, no drowsiness after that), which was a massive deal as I've had horrible insomnia since I was a kid. Normally, I couldn't nap even if I'd been deprived of sleep for days. Suddenly, it felt like napping was an option even though I'd actually gotten 5 hours of sleep the night before.\n\nAll in all, with any medication, don't force yourself past 2 weeks if the side effects are unbearable. My sister does great on adderall, but adderall was NOT good for me. I react better to ritalin and am currently on concerta. There are so many options, far more than I've mentioned, so if one medication isn't working for you, please don't hesitate to tell your doctor and try something else instead."

I'm somewhere between a bit numb and fully braindead in the evenings once the meds wear off, and I hate the sense that it is closing off parts of my life. \n\nMy resolution when I started meds and started to understand this was \"it's still worth it\". The pain, shame and stress I felt when my life was upended by losing a job was awful, and so to feel confident that's not about to happen again really big. \n\nI've even considered trying to stop meds to avoid the meds crash, but I suspect it's a grass is always greener thing, and if I stopped I'd just go back to wanting stability."

I‚Äôve found that I‚Äôm able to carry my productivity later in the day when I have the extra medication during my lunch break.\n\nSo I suggest bringing this concern up with your doctor! You might have the same struggle. Best of luck!"

The pace at which I get work done isn't really any slower. My brain activity has just feels less rushed and more deliberate is the best way I can put it."

Keeping my shoes on also helps with that. If I stop to take off shoes or sit on the couch it's game over.\n\nAs stupid as it sounds, designating a night to ONE household task and being stubborn about maintaining it helps me.

For me that was either cleaning a room (my room is always messy), playing guitar or doing a quick workout (calisthenics). \n\nThe way I would do things is: \n\n1) Come home from work, hate life for 30 mins\n2) Put some music on that I liked or put some light TV on in the background. I would put sitcoms on in the background for hours, it just works for me. \n3) Write down the things I NEED to do that day (usually replying to emails or just random bits). This would help me visualise what I am going to get done. It's also important not to go overboard. \n4) Start one of the tasks, like an email and just leave it on draft\n5) Do a workout or clean or whatever\n7) Finish that email and use that to push myself to finish the rest\n8) Eat and do my nighttime / bed routine. \n\nThe big change for me was identifying exactly what needed to be done. Often I would overload myself and it would become a bandwidth issue. \n\nHaving something to look forward to at the end, which for me was a joint and a movie, helped a lot in getting things done also."

If you have the gift of time management and dont struggle with the \"just do it\" aspect, it's amazing; but if you lack that skill/awareness, a larger chunk of your time is actually wasted (not making money while also not engaging in fulfilling hobbies, ect with the extra free time). \n\nStructuring the extra free time is imperative. Otherwise, you end up right back in the loop of \"ugh, don't know what to do other than work, but I don't want to work.\""

Still trying to figure out the best way to get the most out of it while dealing with the side effects. I take 1 or 2 days off per week (usually on the weekends) because I‚Äôm afraid of building tolerance but when I go back on I barely sleep the first night, I don‚Äôt feel like going to the gym when my feel so ‚Äúon‚Äù so I have to go first thing in the morning or I don‚Äôt go, I get headaches near the end of the day, and I‚Äôve lost 5 pounds (now at 143). Plus I don‚Äôt seem to be getting all that much from it anymore. The biggest benefit had been the drive to get things done, but now even that is going away. So today my Dr suggested trying something else and prescribed Qelbree. I‚Äôm not gonna have high hopes now, but we‚Äôll see how it goes. Of course it‚Äôs another $300+ per month drug."

I kinda brain-vomited below but have some questions for you (past the brain-vom) if you have the time to answer \n\n\nI‚Äôm currently 200mg for 7 days and all I‚Äôve noticed is borderline day ruining fatigue, and last night I genuinely couldn‚Äôt sleep due to such a powerful headache, which weirdly wasn‚Äôt helped at all by ibuprofen. \n\nI‚Äôm only 7 days in and I‚Äôm also about 2 weeks off strattera (the ‚Äúdetox‚Äù from that was b r u t a l) so I‚Äôm doing my best to take the new side effects I'm assuming from Q with a grain of salt. With that said, the worst sides from Q (minus that headache potentially) don‚Äôt even touch how bad the sides from Strat were for me so far, so that‚Äôs good :) my sleep is still crazy but already miles improved from what it was like with Strat.\n\nI‚Äôm also starting my adhd journey a bit later in life- I‚Äôm an otherwise p ‚Äúnormal‚Äù 36yr old dude. Also on 100mg of Wellbutrin \n\nA few questions for you if you have the time:\n\n\n-Did you find the fatigue go away after a few weeks? Im currently a barista and I‚Äôve read that Q has an interesting interaction with Caffeine -which worries me considering how tired and sluggish I‚Äôve been.\n\n-When did you begin to feel a cognitive benefit? I haven‚Äôt felt anything cognitively outside of some emotional deregulation in waves, which again I try to take with a grain of salt for now as I adjust. \n\n-Probably something else I‚Äôm forgetting, ha.\n\n\nWhatever the case, I appreciate you taking the time for your original post and just know that your level of anecdotal detail *is* noticed and it *is* helpful so don‚Äôt let anyone tell you differently :)"

I found myself feeling *very grateful* that I have a supportive home environment and that I have a good internal dialogue that is positive and coaches me through tougher times.\n\nI have a 6yo stepson, and one thing my partner and I work on with him is mental and emotional resilience. I found my resilience being tested very often on this drug at first, and I really needed to lean on coping mechanisms developed after my 29 years to get me through those times. I think your daughter will really need *you* to be her coach through this, which will be difficult since you cannot read her mind and because she is still only a child and may not recognize/communicate the need for such support. She may also have under-developed coping mechanisms, like most other children, based on her age alone. I hope she will fare better, but it's something to keep in mind, I think!\n\nStill, I'd like to confirm that 9 days after my last post, the side effects have subsided even more. And I still find the drug life-changing!\n\nPlease keep us (or just me!) updated on her progress. I'm both curious and emotionally invested now, lol.

    "comment": "Yes to both! I'll clarify by dividing memory into the two main ways that I feel suffered by my ADHD. \n\n**Remembering Tasks/Deadlines**: This drug does not work miracles. I don't suddenly remember everything I have to do. I still rely on lists and general visibility (like leaving emails that I need to respond to open on my desktop, etc.). HOWEVER, I am much better about keeping those lists. I have a calendar now (a real physical calendar!) that is up-to-date and clean. I have a working agenda (planner) that I actually REMEMBER TO USE and refer to! So, gone are the days where I'd make a list and then lost it, or make a second list to supplement the first list and then get frustrated with both. My memory now functions in a way that allows me to use real coping skills without help. \n\n**Working Memory (facts about things, details in conversations, etc.)**: This drug does not work miracles (which is worth restating here), but my working memory has improved ten-fold. Now, I can delay taking notes and write things down after-the-fact, and I can better remember small details that I didn't think to jot down. Before, I used to have to literally transcribe conversations and directions in real time if I wanted to remember them. My working memory was always great for my hyperfixations, but boring stuff like work always seemed to be in one ear and out the other. Not anymore! \n\nSo, yeah. It has improved my memory, but I still have the same brain. It hasn't changed, but I just use it better, if that makes sense?"

    "comment": "Hey, I was feeling a lot like you when I started too. I had a ROUGH six months before I was prescribed Qelbree, and I felt really hopeless. \n\nTo further illustrate my fear, I am (used to be) a 5'8\" 30yo woman who comfortably carried 40 more lbs. From June to January, I got a random autoimmune condition and lost 40lbs without trying. I was 100lbs when I took my first pill. \n\nI cried when I read the potential side effects of Qelbree and saw how common they are. It felt *so fucking unfair*. I knew Qelbree was going to raise my heartrate and further suppress my appetite. I was so afraid of losing more weight. I was tired ALL the time, and this drug would make my sleep even worse. My body felt broken. I looked and felt skeletal and sick. I was getting tests done for really scary conditions. My body and mind felt like they didn't even belong to me anymore.  I felt like I had no control over anything. \n\nOn a particularly depressing day, where I was feeling all of the above and then some, I glanced over at my nightstand and saw the bottle of Qelbree pills that I had been ignoring for days. I realized then that I was wrong. I might not have had control over my autoimmune condition or my ADHD, but I did have control over that bottle of Qelbree pills. So, I grabbed one and swallowed it. \n\n\"She plucked, she ate\" - this is a line from John Milton's *Paradise Lost*. (Literature nerd, sorry lmao.) *Paradise Lost* is, essentially, John Milton's rendition of the story of Adam and Eve. As we know, the moment when Eve eats The Apple is, for all intents and purposes, the climax of the story. The entire story builds up to and lays out all the necessary pieces for this one tiny thing to happen... and it's just \"she plucked, she ate.\" That's it. God comes down to explain to Adam and Eve the ways in which the relationship between Man and God is forever transformed. \n\nLooking back, I have similar thoughts about my story. I have suffered from ADHD my entire life, and the mental and emotional toll it was taking on me was only worsening my physical condition, which was already fragile for it's own reasons. Over months and months and months, I felt myself fall deeper and deeper into illness and despair. In hindsight, I can now see that all the moments of illness, pain, depression, and anxiety led me to a doctor who prescribed me Qelbree. I never thought that the tiny act of taking yet another pill would forever transform my life so dramatically. \n\nI'm sorry for how long this is, but I really related to your statement. \"Not feeling so great already.\" Suffering from constipation and bloating (my entire life). Constantly fatigued for seemingly no reason. There was so much more, and I'm sure there is for you too. There were a lot of reasons not to try Qelbree, but I'm really happy that I did. I typed all this out because I hope that in a few months, you'll have the energy (and hope!) that you need."

When your heart rate suddenly spikes, it can make you feel more anxious, or in my case, it can have a stranger effect - it can make you drowsy, uncontrollably sleepy. As you can imagine, I paid attention to these spikes and noticed almost a 10-15 bpm raise over normal. My apple watch logged it too and would warn me sometimes! \n\nBut yeah, I think I‚Äôm almost about 6 months in, and I can‚Äôt remember any heart rate spikes happening in the last two months, at least.

Worse than Guanfacine (which made her a zombie, so tired). And the stimulants made her wake up during the middle of the night and she said she couldn't fall back asleep. \n\nQelbree made my kid miserable, and I didn't realize just how much until she stopped it. She was so angry. Also, we upped the dosage over the course of a few weeks, like the doctor said. She had progressively more and more super hard poops. We tried stool softeners. The last day before we quit it, she was screaming and sweating on the toilet like she was in labor. She screamed more than I did having two natural childbirths. She said it was going to rip her apart, and literally tried at one point to claw it out with her fingers. I was sobbing in my bedroom while my husband coached her.  She missed the bus to school because she had to get this boulder of a poop out and I had to drive her to school. I called her doctor and she said we didn't need to wean her off, could just stop it. \n\nSo we stopped the Qelbree immediately but my husband and I were going out of town for a wedding. We hoped that Grandma wouldn't have to worry about her being miserable cause she stopped the medicine. My daughter was up 5 times during the night to poop (finally normal poops again) and then stayed up after like 4 or 5 am because none of them really slept. It was like she was going through withdrawal, she was just wide awake. Then the following day, she crashed hard. It was awful. \n\nI'm glad it seems to be helping and your kid isn't experiencing any negative side effects. Hopefully it continues to help!"

They seemed to have leveled off to where I felt rather shitty during the day and didn‚Äôt have much energy to do anything. I often had a mild headache. But at night my sleep was horrible. I would get maybe 3-5 hours of light, poor quality sleep, and then I‚Äôd be wide awake the rest of the night. That was so far the worst effect. \n\nThe one pro was that I might have actually been less distracted by other things at work, and wanted to just get my stuff done and go home, but I also was just tired and didn‚Äôt have as much enjoyment of things that I normally liked either. \n\nSo I had been taking it in the morning, but yesterday, the 15th day, I skipped the morning and took it at night. I thought maybe it might make me sleepy and help my sleep. I took it at probably about 10 pm or so, then stayed up late working on taxes. I had a mild annoying headache so took some ibuprofen and went to bed at 1:00. I woke up around 2:15 with a bad headache. Over the next several minutes things got progressively worse: the headache got worse, and I felt a very strange and uncomfortable pressure inside my whole head, like someone had hooked up a bicycle pump to it. I had this weird restless agitation, and I thought I might have a seizure or stroke or something. I‚Äôve never had either, but it just felt like something bad was about to happen. I woke my wife and after a couple minutes decided I should go to the hospital. I also didn‚Äôt feel like I was thinking clearly or getting the words out speaking. On the way there I kept running my fingers through my hair and trying to massage my scalp a little, and I was doing this weird breathing thing where I was taking slow deep breaths and exhaling through pursed lips.  I guess it was worrying my wife a bit and she asked me why I was breathing like that‚ÄîI said I don‚Äôt know. Anyway, it was bad like that for only about 20 minutes, then things gradually calmed down. I was put in a room and they didn‚Äôt run any tests on me before I said I was back to normal. They did give me some Tylenol/naproxen. Blood pressure when I arrived was 155/100, which is high but not super high. That came down to 130/84 by the time I left like 3 hours later. \n\nI don‚Äôt want to discourage anyone from trying this‚ÄîI was really hoping it would work for me like I‚Äôve seen it does for others. There‚Äôs so much diversity between people‚Äôs brains and one often has to try multiple drugs before finding one that works for them. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm gonna try something else or just take a break for a while. I previously tried Vyvanse for a few months which had benefit/side effect issues I was trying to deal with but not like this."

My doc just told me to take 200 mg/day until our next appt so that‚Äôs what I did, but I wouldn‚Äôt have increased anyway with the side effects I was having. Yeah I tried Ritalin about 10 years ago. It raised my blood pressure a lot too. Yeah I guess guanfacine would probably be the next to try, but I‚Äôm a little leery because it is also a norepinephrine-ergic drug like Qelbree. Of course so is Strattera is too and I took it 20 years ago without THESE side effects, unless age is having an effect‚Ä¶ I was actually considering good ol‚Äô therapy too. I don‚Äôt think they would tell me anything I don‚Äôt already know, but maybe it would kind of provide a reset and prod me into sticking to some of the things I know I should be sticking to‚Ä¶"

    "comment": "Ah okay. I‚Äôve fortunately never suffered blood pressure issues from any of the meds. Took Methylphenidate products from like elementary to highschool and then took straterra through high school and the first year of college. Then off meds for a decade. Been trialing them for the past few years. \n\nFWIW Guanfacine is nothing like straterra or Qelbree. I suppose I haven‚Äôt tried Qelbree but pharmacologically they do very different things. Obviously not everyone has the same success with it but guanfacine has probably been the best medication I‚Äôve tried for myself at least. Trying to find the right stimulant to pair with it though as I struggle a bit more with the stimulants. I also did a month trial of Clonidine recently and liked it but the guanfacine is better for me. Had no issues coming off either of them. \n\nFinishing up a trial of wellbutrin right now. Taking guanfacine as well. Loving the motivation and mood benefits from the wellbutrin but I think it‚Äôs making my focus worse and attention span shorter."

    "comment": "you probably are too sensitive to the med and should tell your doctor about how it feels, normally adhd meds don‚Äôt cause sutch a dramatic emotional response; qelbree is not a stimulant, it‚Äôs a NRI witch is weird because NRIs take up to 2 weeks to reach peak effect and taking a NRI won‚Äôt result in any effects on the first dose like adderall or ritalin, except for you so something else must me going on, qelbree can cause mood changes after the first few doses in some instances but these symptoms subside quickly in few days/weeks. feeling like your not yourself can be common for NRIs though and many people feel the same because of neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitors. i don‚Äôt know why you would have sutch a extreme response to this med that takes a fornite to reach peak effect but it is rare that people have serious side effects like this. sometimes NRIs will cause iatrogenic effects (they do the exact opposite of what they are ment to do) so you might just be one of the people who got the short end of the qelbree sick. talk to your doctor!"

    "comment": "More on this- \nPersonally I was prescribed Qelbree a while ago and took it for about a week (so I may not be as experienced as those here who have used it for a longer time)\nI actually ended up stopping it today and switched back to adderall - it made me so uncontrollably exhausted all the time that I even began napping (which is something I never manage to do).\nIn addition, it introduced a few other non-beneficial symptoms, to which my psychiatrist decided that it was simply not right for me. As this user stated, sometimes medications may not work for you, even if they initially sound like they could. I do also agree that it is pretty weird to have those types of intense effects so quickly- especially on the first day, but then again everybody's body and it's function is different.\nI am not a medical professional by any means, so take anything I say with a grain of salt. However, even for my (less intense than yours) side effects, my psychiatrist already deemed that the cons would outweigh the pros. Maybe this will end up being the case for you.\nGood luck, and I hope you find the best help for your struggles possible!"

I have fatigue caused by a chronic physical health condition (dysautonomia) and this is the only thing that has worked for me. Vyvanse takes so long to get started that my mornings were horrible until I started this. I was just exhausted and existing in a fog. But now I wake up awake and alert.\n\nYes it does wear off earlier in the evening, but that's a fair trade off for me as my symptoms (both adhd and dysautonomia) aren't as bad at night. I usually have enough time still medicated to get my evening started and it wears off later. I am a lucky one who gets about 14 hours out of vyvanse, but I also got a Ritalin booster from my doctor, so I take that on days when I need a little more help in the evening.\n\nHighly recommend this method and I'm forever grateful to my best buddy, my late soul cat Parker, who helped me develop this habit by waking me up 2 hours before get up time to feed him, lol."

    "comment": "I do this too, alarm goes off at 5, take my meds, doze back off for a little while or lay with my dog/play on my phone/whatever, then a warning alarm at 545 and another at 6. By then my mind is put together enough to get a shower, get dressed, fix my hair and shave etc, another warning alarm at 650 reminding me it's about time to get on the road, remote start the truck so it's warm and find my wallet and stuff. \n\nBy the time 7 am rolls around im in the truck,  my shit is together, meds are active for the drive and I'm not all frantic and scrambling around. Even if something stupid happens like getting stuck behind a bus or semi truck, I can still make it to work and clock in 3 minutes early at 7:27. \n\nIt's been a game changer for me too, I was on my last warning at work for being 10 minutes late all the time no matter how much I tried to rush and stress to get there on time. I've accepted the fact that I just need to be a bum in the morning and poke around the house and be slow and lazy for a while in the morning before I'm ready to engage in the world, by doing this I can still engage in my guilty pleasure of laying around and procrastinating half awake in the morning but still make it to work on time. \n\nI've even taken to doing this on my days off too, so getting up at a certain time has just become pretty automatic for me and I don't feel like death every morning. I used to always put off taking my ADHD med until the last second because I felt like it would wear off too early (I work 12-14 hours shifts) but honestly I haven't noticed a difference. I get a little spaced out if it's a slow day and I get bored, but I can drink a can of pop or something and pick up the pace again pretty easily"

Maybe your doctor would feel more comfortable trying a higher dose if you mention you need caffeine still at this dose to function but that you suspect you will need less or even none at the next highest dose. Which could very well be true - I used to need to drink a Monster every morning to get anything started (more than once a day before I eat on any meds at all) but once I was on the right dose of Ritalin I realized that I still opened a monster out of habit but would only have taken a few sips before forgetting about it completely because I felt better and more productive than I used to with it. I also have less anxiety or racing heart because in order to have enough caffeine to have an effect it means you also need enough to start having negative sugar effects.\n\nSo maybe you can make the case that you commit to giving up caffeine on the next higher dose of vyvanse (though do taper off so you don't get awful caffeine withdrawal headaches)? I don't know if that is something you would want to try or she would agree with, but I know my psych was very happy I naturally lost dependency on caffeine even though she wasn't trying to make me do that specifically.\n\nAlso maybe you could shop around for a doctor that knows more about ADHD and isn't so afraid of stimulants. Another thing that can help, if it's true, is something that is very common - you may sometimes forget to take your stimulant because you have ADHD. It's ironic but it points to a lack of addiction, and that the meds work for your and you're not just drug seeking like some doctors fear."

    "comment": "I experienced a pretty similar reaction to it, very similar to yours (but on a higher dose). This sounds like it's not the right fit and dose, and if your gp is so set against stimulants, a scientifically backed, widely accepted treatment method, you really need to look into seeing a specialist who is more knowledgeable and aware of the struggles caused by this condition bc this is not ok or fair to you in any way. I'm actually getting pretty upset hearing what's been happening to you as I have experienced it in relation to my disability and chronic pain and know first hand what this can do to a person mentally and physically. \n\n You're getting a small taste of help dangled in front of you, enough to see what you'd be like without so many unnecessary struggles but then because of your gps discomfort, personal biases, belief in stigmas, or lack of knowledge your also being told \"nope, too bad that's all the help you get\" even though it's clear as day you need more help, but something that's a better fit. What really cements it is you can't even speak up to try to see if there is more help or better help out there for you. Your gp has created a scary, hostile environment where you now fear any and all help being withdrawn if you mention anything other than 100% success of the current treatment (even though you went through months and months of failed treatments that sound like they were possibility somewhat forced on you against your wishes by this current practitioner). None of this is ok. I'm so sorry you're going through this, and I know how hard it can be to express what's happening and ask for help and to state your needs when you are scared because you know how much worse it can be if that little bit of help you currently have is taken away from you. You are allowed to want more and want better for yourself. You're not wrong, bad, selfish, or anything negative for asking for more in life, for asking for better treatment, for wanting to not struggle needlessly when help is available but simply not being given for illegitimate reasons. You are worthy of more, worthy of better care, worth being listened to and most importantly you should be believed and deserve a doctor that will listen and believe you and value you, yoir experience and your opinion (including your opinionon your treatment). \n\nIt's wrong for your dr to leave you to suffer and struggle just so they can avoid the fact that they might not be the best person to treat you, they may not have the right fit personally and professionally but instead of putting your medical needs and well being first the drs feelings are being valued above all.  Sure, it may not have started out that way and i can understand sometimes starting with the least risky or invasive treatment but after so many long months of alternative treatments and them totally failing and you asking almost begging for the main stream treatment a truly caring person and a good dr would have considered that they may not have the right tools to treat you best and you might be better off with a specialist. Instead of that happening you were kept in this unnecessary perpetutual hell while your dr kept on with downplaying your needs, your struggle and your experience. It's really messed up.\n\n If we were taking about diabetes and your gp didn‚Äôt have the experience and knowledge to find the right meds to control your blood sugar would you even hesitate to move on to a specialist, would you be second guessing yourself and thinking maybe its on you or letting any shame or self doubt stop you from getting the help you need? If a dr kept you on as a patient when they didn't know how to treat your diabetes properly and for many months rejected all of the widely accepted efficacious forms of treatment to instead try all these shots in the dark that actually ended up hurting you more.... what would you call a dr like that? Selfish, unprofessional, unaware, inept, uncaring, heartless, dangerous etc... why do we feel that way when it's diabetes but when its adhd we mentally twist and turn ourselves inside-out to justify the drs actions?\n\nYour adhd is just as worthy of proper treatment as diabetes or any other chronic and life changing diagnosis. \n\nYou need better, more specialized and knowledgeable care. You deserve help, and you're not just being difficult. This is a legitimate medical need that requires attention and is worthy of attention. You deserve better, you shouldn't have to fear having assistance and treatment withdrawn simply because you dare to speak up about the possibility of modifying the current approach for valid reasons.\n\n You deserve better and it sounds like your current provider isn't capable of doing better for the reasons mentioned above and especially because their behavior has made you fear them and their inability to listen to you and your needs and make a well reasoned plan with your input, they have lost your trust in numerous ways. Please seriously consider getting a refferal to a specialist. Best wishes and lots of hugs!!!\n\nEdit: I saw what you said about dr shortages. Maybe get the referral abs very carefully try ti speak with your gp since they are going to continue to treat you unil you get in to see a specialist. I know I went a bit intense but a dr refusing help they way she is with the \"I refuse to dabble in psychiatry\" but also failing to send you to one or offer any real help is just shamefull. I would go in and get the referral and confidently talk about altering your current meds and dose to get a better fit (not my place to tell you how, that's for you to explore) and mention that you really want to try making X change while you wait to see a specialists (which I assume will be a few months). Just my feelings and suggestions so feel free to ignore them. Again best wishes."

When I switched to Elvanese, I started on 40 mg which barely lasted 8 hours, together with my psychiatrist, I was stepped up 50 mg and then 60 mg. 60 mg Elvanse was the first stimulant dosage that finally felt like it had the intended effect, buy it still only lasted around 10-12 hours, which for a parent attending university, is not enough.\n\nNow I take 70 mg Elvanse. It works like advertised. I could not be happier with my meds. Hope this helps. Good luck."

I recently skimmed through a paper on the effects of combining caffeine and adderall, and it encouraged me to try at least delaying my initial hit of caffeine. Basically, taken together, caffeine may actually make adderall less effective for increasing focus and self-actualizating while also making the anxiety-inducing side effect of caffeine worse. I'm not finding the specific paper I was reading, but this article gives a good synopsis of what I'm talking about if you go down to the part where they describe the interaction between the two stimulants: https://granitemountainbhc.com/blog/how-do-adderall-and-caffeine-interact-with-each-other/"

Then you will probably come back here again haha. Ok lets go:\n\nTime. Difficulties with time management due to a dopamine. The list of why is long. But it is commonly accepted that ADHD = difficulties with time.\n\n\"Negative\" emotions. There are no negative emotions. There are just emotions. Even feeling negative, is not a negative emotion. \nIf \"negative\" emotions were a danger to humans, we wouldnt have passed them on to further generations.\nBut a feeling such as anxiety, does however, release more dopamine. Which is really helpful if you have ADHD.\n\nMasking and (over)compensating\nThrough experience/observation/perceived value or what, you know how it should be. And you know you do not like the consequences if you cannot live up to it. So you mask or you compensate. Maybe you even go as far as over-compensate. ADHD can do the same as non-ADHD. The difference is in the cost. Ask yourself how much energy it costs you to manage time?\n\nWaiting\nWhat is waiting? For ADHD it is the function of time and focus. Without time management you will be late. Without focus you will forget. And actually even more, but I wont list them. Example, impatience) \nSo for ADHD waiting is not in the semantic category of \"states of rest\" like sleeping and relaxing.\nWaiting for ADHD is an activity.\n\nSo to the point, based on the above. I would suggest that waiting and generally being on time is not so much your hyper fixation as much as it is an over-compensatory activity you spend great amounts of energy on.\n\nIn other words and much simpler;\n\nDont worry my fellow ADHD friend.\nYou dont waste time waiting. \nYou complete marathons."

My new GP is his daughter hired on to the same group practice.\n\nMy then-new GP referred me to a 10 minute phone interview (plague times) with a hospital psych who listened to my notes about the impulsiveness, space-casing, etcetc. The phone doc focused on my \"it's not all the time\" and insisted to my GP I was 100% type-2 bipolar. After a 10 minute phone call. \n\nI'd gone so long being dismissed by the previous doctor that I was stupidly so \"happy\" that I was being taken seriously about something not being right and something was getting done to help me. I was told it wouldn't be perfect, and I'd have to push through. So I did. I was stubborn about it, too. Never missed a single dose, thanks mostly to my partner. I wanted *so* badly to be better, you know? \n\nThey kept me on that med for 2 years, sending me to test after test every time I brought up complaints about side effects. Blood tests, even sent in for an MRI. I finally put my foot down but it took me way too long. And the longer I was on it, the worse my memory and emotional regulation got, but \"well this medication doesn't do that so let's find the real cause.\" So long as my skin wasn't literally sloughing off, she said, we'd be able to work through it. \n\nMy friend, in the end I very nearly lost the ability to do basic math. I'm talking 2-digit-numbers basic math. I still count on my fingers for the little stuff. I would lose not only sentences but whole trains of conversation mid-word. For a time I couldn't type without stopping every so often to say spellings out loud, and even then I would get frustrated when for the fifth time in a row my fingers type \"they're\" instead of \"there\" despite me watching in tears and saying the correct spelling letter by letter as I go, like there was a disconnect between my brain and the muscle memory. And oh, the *rage* episodes. Can't forget about the rage over nothing. That shit was terrifying. \n\nThere was more, and quite honestly I don't think it's an exaggeration to call those the worst 2 years of my life... What I can remember of them. My memory is mostly bouncing back now that I'm off it, and the other symptoms too. Thankfully.\n\nNeedless to say these days I'm very vigilant about negative side effects and putting my foot down."

    "comment": "I used to think mine worked just like that. For context, I've been taking meds for over 12 years, tried Adderall XR/IR, Vyvanse, Concerta/Ritalin. I had this experience on all of them - \"my meds don't last long enough, I keep crashing early\" and the doctors would just give me more to take in the afternoon. I even went to see one of the top ADHD psychiatrists in my region of the country and he did this too.\n\nI took a few years off meds but started again recently. This is how I overcame the early crashing:\n\n1) you have to be on top of your shit in terms of sleep, exercise, diet, and HYDRATION. If you sleep like crap, eat like crap, and don't drink water like a fish (I probably drink 5-6 liters a day) you will get those crashes\n\n2) SOME level of cognitive dip during those hours is normal, as you can see on a sleep tracking app like RISE. You'll experience a \"morning peak\", an \"afternoon dip\", and a second \"evening peak.\" That is a natural flow to the human circadian rhythm\n\n3) For me, what I learned was that the standard dosages were just too damn high for me. I must be incredibly sensitive to amphetamines. I wasn't crashing because the meds weren't enough, but because I was so fucking wired in the mornings that I just did not have the energy to keep going later on. I'd be *too wired* to get anything productive done in the mornings, my most productive periods were always after my smaller afternoon dose. I would have insane side effects - the shits, tons of mucus, terrible jaw clenching at night, full on zombie mode in the evenings. It was bad, and every doctor I saw just treated it as a fact of life with these meds.\n\nAnd I've been on all the doses of Vyvanse for example, 30, 40, 50, 60. Tried all those standard doses of Concerta and Adderall as well. What worked for me was going *lower* - I started back up with 10 milligrams of Vyvanse, rode it out for a month, and realized I had virtually no side effects. Focus-wise and energy-wise it wasn't doing quite enough so I went up to 20. I saw a big improvement, perhaps a little too much - started having some more of those negative side effects + that extremely wired feeling locking me up in the mornings, but it's low enough to be manageable. So I know now not to go higher.\n\nAnd now, I don't crash or go into zombie mode. My days are completely smooth and I can actually effectively utilize the second peak. I don't feel like my meds \"run out early\"\n\nand 4) I got some ADHD coaching. Not therapy, but coaching. Big difference. I've done therapy for years and still do it. But therapy is way more focused on the past and on your emotional health - ADHD coaching teaches you the executive function skills you need in order to actually do the things you're trying to do. And it doesn't take anywhere near as long as therapy - just 3-4 months is enough to learn the building blocks to make some big big changes. A lot of the things we struggle with due to ADHD are also just things we never really learned how to do because they don't come naturally to our brains, and/or the \"normal\" way of doing them doesn't apply. There are ADHD ways to do things like setting goals, planning, breaking tasks down, overcoming obstacles with task initiation or focus, etc. that WORK\n\nReposting because automod got mad I used a certain word"

My grades were not high enough to get into a masters program so essentially my degree is toilet paper.\n\nSo I tried teaching, sucked at it, and ended up going into an accounting program."

Although EFs are complex, their impairment constitutes a syndrome that can be recognized readily in clinical practice; impaired EF involves a pattern of chronic difficulties in executing a wide variety of daily tasks.\n\nAlso, cognitive tests are not part of the usual diagnostic procedure for identifying ADHD.\n\nI think it would be reasonable for you to look for a second opinion."

But without those issues holding me back it seemed to highlight that my inability to just do shit remained, regardless.\n\nShe kept asking me, \"How's your focus? How's your concentration?\" And I'm just like, same as it's always been. I feel like I concentrate okay on things I'm interested in but doing tasks I don't enjoy is extremely hard.\n\n\"That's normal.\"\n\nNo, I don't think you understand. But, we were still early in our sessions.\n\nSo, she asked me again in our last appointment about my concentration and I told her it's still spotty with things I don't enjoy, including versions of things I do enjoy but the tedious parts of them, but that I caught a wave of motivation and I'm just riding it for as far as it will take me before it runs out.\n\nShe told me she didn't realize I was hyperfocusing, and we started talking more about executive dysfunction.\n\nI told her I honestly don't care what I end up getting labeled, I just want to function and have the ability to set routines. She agreed that executive dysfunction can also be a result of PTSD and put me on a low dose of Wellbutrin. It hasn't been very long and I don't feel \"fixed\" but certain things have been easier and I'm looking for motivation less and just doing things a little more. It's slow starting but I can feel it helping already.\n\nMaybe it's ADHD, maybe it's PTSD, maybe it's Maybelline. I don't care. I have some routines again."

    "comment": "It is another opinion in the grand scheme of things! Doctors don‚Äôt always have the right answers when it comes to what would be considered a mental health or neurological issue. Psychiatry is notoriously known for giving mixed opinions on diagnoses such as ADHD. The reality is, ADHD can be considered a spectrum disorder so you can still HAVE it while also not exhibiting what would be considered ‚Äútypical‚Äù symptoms of ADHD or even testing ‚Äúnegative‚Äù on a likely outdated test. So much additional research NEEDS to go into ADHD in general. We are now finding that females by birth have been historically under diagnosed when it comes to ADHD, and the data is currently showing that they do experience symptoms that aren‚Äôt even the same as males which have been commonly misdiagnosed as other disorders like bipolar/manic depression and other mood disorders. That is another discussion and side quest for another day but I would see another doctor if you can if you are unhappy with her opinion. Don‚Äôt let her gaslight you, either. You know yourself better than anyone else and the symptoms and history you‚Äôve described to her are valid and can be interpreted a bunch of different ways by many different practitioners. \n\nHope this helps."

    "comment": "My understanding of the current thinking about ADD is that it *is* executive dysfunction. That's the idea that Bradley (among others) has been defending for a few years now, and I think he's on to something.\n\nSo for your psychiatrist to say somethjng like \"that's not attention deficit, that's just executive dysfunction\" is basically like someone you're having a slice of pizza with, and they say \"pass me the red pepper\" and you hand them the jar and they look at it and say \"that's just chili pepper, not red pepper\". You follow me?\n\nAttentional issues are just just one of several important aspects of cogntiive control that collectively come under the more inclusive label of \"executive function\". Given that so much of being a healthy competent functioning member of our society is related to attentional control that means its usually what gets spotted first. So it was (mis)labelled \"attention deficit\" and as a result all those other aspects of executive functioning that are important--affective regulation, social reasoning, decision making, motivational control, memory rrgulation, metacognition--get shoved aside and ignored.\n\nFor me, the clearest indicator that a person has AD is their response to stimulants. If a person experiences the paradoxical effect of stimulants being *calming*--where they feel like the noise in their heads going quiet and that voice in your head always chattering suddenly STFU--that right there is the proof positive that a person has it. \n\nPeople in your shrink's position have troubl convincing themselves theyre not just legal drug dealers. And they really need to feel like that definitely, 100% for sure controlled substance theyre giving you legal permission to take, isnt just you being a grubby drug seeker, and theyre enabling that and enabling your drug addiction.\n\nThese neuro tests that she had you take I think are a bit of window dressing. For now theyre not definitive but youre seeing them more and more, because theu appear to be the sort of thing a person cant fake their way through, if you follow me. But I am not really sure the degree to which there is or is not a characteristic pattern of responding on them that distinguishes between \"true\" ADD and people who are faking or malingerjng or whatever."

    "comment": "I didn‚Äôt read all of that lol. But read ‚ÄúDriven to distraction‚Äù it talks about what you basically said. If providers are too focused on the tests rather than relying much more on the patient‚Äôs history, then they may miss a diagnosis because people that have ADHD can do well with ADHD tests due to the novelty of it all, the doctor‚Äôs office, the test. I for example, thought the test was stupid and tried to do very well on it; I had seen it as a game tbh. I don‚Äôt see how missing a shape when the voice spoke could equate to me not being ‚Äúimpulsive.‚Äù Like sure, just disregard how messy my whole life has been, OKAY.\n\nAnyway, met up with one psychiatrist who had me take what I believe was an IVA-2 test. Basically she said since I responded so well to it and my results were consistent with some minor symptoms that can be applicable to anyone, that basically I wasn't presenting as having ADHD . She wanted me to do further testing with their psychologist if I wanted a diagnosis. Note, this woman had a whole ass PHD and she seemed reluctant to prescribe me stimulants. She was a sweet and caring lady but there is so much misunderstanding about ADHD. At our first appointment after I had told her about my history, she prescribed me Strattera. I had told her how ever since I started college and realized there was something wrong with me, I kept trying to get a psychiatrist to diagnose my ADHD since it was making my college life disastrous, and every single one of them brushed me under the rug, saying with my comorbid depression and anxiety, they weren‚Äôt sure it was ADHD.\n\nAlso at our first appointment after hearing about how absolutely horrendous my life had been she had been like ‚Äúwell, aren‚Äôt you glad I didn‚Äôt just prescribe you a stimulant?‚Äù Like‚Ä¶ umm‚Ä¶ no?!? If it‚Äôs the first line of action for ADHD OF COURSE I want what‚Äôs most likely to help me!!! I‚Äôd rather ADHD be over-diagnosed and the medication into the wrong hands, as that is their choice, than the medication not being able to be sought out by those that truly need them just because it‚Äôs a controlled substance and there are so many damn regulations around them.\n\nWell surprise, surprise, just as when I was given Wellbutrin before when I was on state insurance (absolutely sucks btw and that one, I learned - Molina Healthcare - does not recognize ADHD as being an adult disorder and does not cover ADHD medication for adults), which didn‚Äôt work, Strattera didn‚Äôt either.\n\nTurns out insurance doesn‚Äôt cover psychological testing for ADHD either, so that would‚Äôve been a waste of my time. Not that I tried to seek out the testing, as my life is already chaos, and that just added more of a barrier that seemed insurmountable, as did just about almost any task I took on my entire life if it had more than a few steps.\n\nI stuck it out with Strattera for months though before my job duties changed and I was left doing boring, monotonous, and repetitive tasks that left me so unstimulated that I‚Äôd end up going on my phone while on the job, while achieving the bare minimum. I would meet our metrics, sometimes go slightly under, but I realized then that ‚Äúholy shit, they‚Äôre always saying that ADHD affects every facet of your life, including your job. Well here I am now! Seemingly affected.‚Äù I so badly wanted to be a good employee. I saw others do so well at their job and wish I could be as good at my job as them. It was then that I realized that yes, there‚Äôs definitely a problem if, even though I know there are consequences of losing my job, I‚Äôm still goofing off. Before this, every other job I had had was a high stimulation job, so it had never clicked (daycare, fast food).\n\nWell, I ended up going with a different physiatrist. Well that one ended up fucking me over, but at least I got the diagnosis that I needed from her and took it to a different provider. My life has changed immensely since starting stimulants. I will always advocate for people to seek treatment because being undiagnosed can absolutely ruin your life.\n\nAnyway, being diagnosed was an absolute journey and a terrible one at that. Once I got diagnosed, I was resentful that I had spent so many years thinking I was a screw up and not having achieved my potential, when had I been listened to before, I could have done so much more with my life now, than being stuck at home, living with my parents, failing out of college, at some dead end call center job. I‚Äôm finally getting my life together now surely, but slowly.\n\nBut it sucks, I feel like I‚Äôm making up for lost time and I feel guilt now whenever I‚Äôm unproductive now, as before it was hard to ever start, let alone, complete a task. Now that I can, that‚Äôs all I ever want to do, to finally better my life.\n\nSorry for the disorganization, have a lot to do but wanted to quickly share my experience if it should help anyone."

    "comment": "Not sure if the following will help you with wither your ADHD diagnosis or a differential diagnosis, but I find it quite interesting.  Executive Function significant differences can be found with ADHD, Dyslexia, Autism, Traumatic Brain Injuries, and more! \n\nThis is directly from a BRIEF-2 analysis that I happen to have my hands on re: executive function and ADHD. \n\n\"The BRIEF2 Inhibit and Working Memory scales , in the context of a comprehensive\r\nassessment may be helpful in identifying children with suspected\r\nattention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Theoretically, inhibitory control\r\nenables self-regulation, and working memory enables sustained attention. It is\r\nimportant at the outset, however, to appreciate the distinction between executive\r\nfunctions and the diagnosis of ADHD: Executive functions are neuropsychological\r\nconstructs, whereas ADHD is a neuropsychiatric diagnosis based on a cluster of\r\nobserved symptoms. Although it is well-established that different aspects of executive\r\ndysfunction contribute to the symptoms that characterize ADHD, executive dysfunction\r\nis not synonymous with a diagnosis of ADHD. Further, problems with inhibitory\r\ncontrol and, in particular, working memory are not unique to the diagnosis of ADHD\r\nbut may be seen in many developmental and acquired conditions. Therefore, the\r\nfollowing analysis may be useful when there is a question about the presence or absence\r\nof an attention disorder but should not be used in isolation or as the sole basis of\r\ndiagnosis. Information from the BRIEF2 may be helpful when combined with other\r\ninformation such as parent and teacher ratings on broad-band scales, ADHD specific\r\nscale clinical interviews, observations and performance assessment.\"\n\n\"Profile analyses have shown that children diagnosed with different disorders often have\r\nrecognizable and logical scale profiles on the BRIEF2. Children with ADHD, inattentive\r\npresentation (ADHD-I) tend to have greater elevations on Working Memory\r\nPlan/Organize, and Task-Monitor scales than their typically developing peers but lower\r\nscores on the BRI and ERI than children diagnosed with ADHD, combined presentation\r\n(ADHD-C).\"\n\n\"The BRIEF2 Parent Form Working Memory scale exhibits good sensitivity and\r\nspecificity for detecting a likely diagnosis of ADHD regardless of whether inattentive or\r\ncombined presentation. [n research and clinical samples, T scores of 55 or greater on the\r\nWorking Memory scale discriminated between healthy controls and children with\r\neither ADHD-I or ADHD-C with over 80% classification accuracy.The likelihood that a\r\nchild with a T score of 65 or higher is a true case of ADHD was .90 (positive predictive\r\nvalue), whereas the likelihood that a child with a score below 65 would not have ADHD\r\nwas .80 (negative predictive value). The likelihood of a child being correctly identified\r\nas meeting criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD was 7 times greater with a Working\r\nMemory T score of 55 or greater.\"\n\n\"The Inhibit scale can help further distinguish between children with ADHD-I versus\nthose with ADHD-C. Using a T score of 55 or greater, approximately 75% of children\nwere correctly classified as being diagnosed with ADHD-C versus ADHD-I in separate\nresearch and clinical samples. Children with T scores at or above 65 on the Inhibit scale\nare 1.5 to 3 times more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD-C than ADHD-I. If the cutoff\nis increased to a T score of 70 or greater on the Inhibit scale, sensitivity is reduced but\nspecificity is increased. Children with T scores of.70 or more are 2.3 to more than 5 times\nmore likely to have a diagnosis of ADHD-C than ADHD-I.\""

    "medication": "Qelbree",
    "comment": "This is a complicated question because there are elements of these that can be seen as either anxiety or ADHD.\n\nThe way my psychologist explained it was that you can have anxiety that is causing symptoms of ADHD.\n\nThe idea is that your anxiety is causing a lot of subconscious ‚Äúbackground processing‚Äù that is interfering with your ability to attend to a stimulus with the ability to recall and remember it. So yes, if you score low on it, it could mean you have low executive functioning, but it could just as well mean that you have anxiety that, if treated, could free up your mind from its background processing and give you more space to attend to stimuli.\n\nFor example, students with social phobia are too focus on their insecurities when attending class, which causes them to miss out on most of a lecture. Yes, they weren‚Äôt paying attention, but not because they have an intrinsic deficit in attention.\n\nThere are several tests that psychologists run to assess actual focused attention. Not sure which ones your psychologist ran, but I‚Äôd be curious to know them and their results.\n\nBut unlike a lot of other commenters here, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily a bad idea to first rule out anxiety. I think mood disorders should always be ruled out before arriving at ADHD as a diagnosis. A lot of people have underlying depression that the stimulant med ends up treating, so they think that they have ADHD since the med works, which is not really the right way to look at it."

    "comment": "The place I was assessed at was great, they looked for more than one diagnosis and did it over 3 interviews. First was to learn about me, my experiences, my symptoms, family history, medical history, etc. \n\nThen the psychologist used all of that to develop a line of testing to rule things out or find clues for a diagnosis. I think I did like 3 hours of testing with my psychologist and then 1-2 hours of self-reporting data and questionnaires. \n\nThen weeks later we met to discuss and she gave me a packet with empirical data points that helped support her reasoning for the diagnosis. \n\nIt was pretty interesting, I asked about certain tests and she gave me the reason for the tests and what they concluded, etc. \n\nLike an example was list recall. She could give me a story, ask me to repeat it back to her best I could. Then 5 minutes later do the same. Then 10 minutes later ask if I remember the story. Then see that my short term working memory was below average and I had better recall at 10 minutes then I did after just hearing it. Showing signs that my organizational memory is a ‚Äúweak point‚Äù.\n\nOr I don‚Äôt know the basis of another test I did but when I completed it she told me, ‚ÄúCongrats, you don‚Äôt show signs a personality disorder.‚Äù \n\nAnd at the end of it all, she explained how it‚Äôs normal for people to have a baseline and then when you find data that‚Äôs two deviations from baseline it‚Äôs evidence of a potential diagnosis. So for me, I was high average and exceptional average for most things. My two deviations below were average and low average, and my verbal recall and organizational memory was lower than that. So she used the data from those test among other things she tests, like ruling out sleep apnea and vitamin d levels, to backup her adhd diagnosis. \n\nWhich is why the psychiatrist I‚Äôm seeing now worries me, she just looked at a readout from 2 tests and said, ‚Äúthe machine is telling me you don‚Äôt have it so you don‚Äôt have it.‚Äù"

    "comment": "Tbh I moved countries so had to be rediagnosed before I could be medicated and I got told - within under 5 mins of meeting the guy - \"but you have a masters degree it can't be adhd, it must just be anxiety\", he also added \"when I see assessments for adhd it is 7 year old boys who are bouncing off the walls, you've sat still since you came in here. \n\nI told him I got diagnosed at 10 or 11 when I got held back in maths when it was the single subject I did best in, I failed because I often didn't complete tests in the allotted time, and rarely turned in homework. I told him how I came to my teacher crying telling him how bored I was and I couldn't do it again for another year, and how teacher said I haven't proved I knew the material enough to move on. I asked teacher to give me any problem from anywhere in the next years text book, and he gave me a very random pre-algebra problem on the whiteboard and when I solved it, he kept giving me new ones and said after several I was completing work two years ahead of where I currently was (the level I was being held back in). So he scheduled a meeting with my parents and told them to get me tested for adhd. He then let me take home work to complete, if relevant medicated, over the summer and if I completed it all they'd let me test into an appropriate level class the following autumn. That autumn I turned in all the work and they did let me test into the class up and I passed with a perfect grade the following year. \n\nThe psych considers this for a minute and says it sounds like you were bored, have oppositional defiance disorder and anxiety, none of that sounds like adhd. \n\nAnd I was like that was one thing, i did in fact have an entire assessment, had another one at 19 after starting university and now this is my third and you're declining to even do an assessment. \n\nHe says why don't we try to treat the anxiety and revisit if you're still having issues. I had already waited nearly a year to get *re-diagnosed a third time* and I'm not being taken out now just to be put back on a new waiting list. He booked me in for an anxiety assessment. I told him I do have anxiety but it's from my adhd and not an issue outside of it (not generalised, not social etc) \n\nI submitted a complaint ahead of my assessment that I didn't like the way I was essentially written off after a less than fifteen minute conversation which didn't include the breakdown, severe depression etc trying to finish the masters on time caused lmao (I stopped sleeping to get it all done hahaha) and that it gave the impression the psychologist seemed to believe you couldn't be any kind of intelligent and also have adhd, nor any of my history of beyond that one thing etc. \n\nSo they responded to my complaint by requesting to record my adhd assessment so it could be reviewed by a panel of six which would include no fewer than two adhd specialists. \n\nThey called me back like less than a week later saying I needed medication restarted immediately üòÇüò≠üòÇüò≠ and they changed my psych üòÇ\n\nIf it comes to it, don't be afraid to raise a complaint politely (at first) it might help more than you think, and might correct a psych who might just need an education refresher (medical professionals are constantly refreshing their educational knowledge and it doesn't mean she's necessarily bad at her job just because she might need a refresher, but if it is an issue it will help others not just yourself)"

    "comment": "I don't want to come across as defending the psych because something does seem off to me too, but I'm fairly sure that executive dysfunction is a legit diagnosis. \n\nFrom what I understand, executive dysfunction is a symptom that has a great deal of overlap with ADHD (to the degree that it is the most definitive symptom for anyone with ADHD), but ADHD is not the only cause of that symptom. Further confusing things is that many of the implications of having executive dysfunction are going to look a lot like ADHD: forgetfulness, distractability, difficulty following instructions, etc. \n\nAn example of another cause is anxiety, because it restricts higher thought processes. However in that case the symptom is probably only going to present in specific anxiety inducing situations. I'd imagine that an executive dysfunction diagnosis serves as a catch all for those cases where it is clearly present but the person doesn't fit diagnostic criteria for any of the related issues.\n\nIt does make a difference because the treatment should be different. Like if it was caused by a tumor, the person would be pretty upset to find out that they had been misdiagnosed with ADHD. Surely there should be follow up steps to that diagnosis though? I'd be reaching out to the psych and asking for clarification."

I have an acquaintance who felt awful on Concerta, but Strattera was their perfect match.\n\nIf we decided which medication we should try based on our experiences, neither myself or this acquaintance would've ever found the medication that worked perfectly for us. \n\nYou'll find nightmare stories and success stories with every ADHD medication, it's such an individual experience. Get off the reviews and read the medication information leaflet instead. Be aware of the possible side effects, but don't let it consume you."

I personally don't like the idea of stimulants because I came across a few things in my research (don't remember them now) that suggested that they can have a negative effect on your brain chemistry on the long run. I also have pretty strong anxiety and these two things don't go together. Maybe your doc's reasoning is similar? \n\nIn any case, *an* *open conversation is crucial*.

I'd ask if she's willing to try any stimulants. If she's not, I'd say OK, and I'd also ask her to provide supervision to taper off the Wellbutrin and Strattera. And while you're working on that...find a new doctor and transfer care. \n\nI simply do not understand why doctor's still hold the opinion that stimulants for adults with ADHD should be reserved for the classroom. Why should you only get treatment for your disability if you're in a classroom setting? Why do you not deserve treatment for your disability regardless of your life situation - in school, working, maintaining a home/raising children, etc.? If your disability impacts your life, you deserve treatment. And yeah, sometimes treatment isn't available, but in your case it IS."

Tried me on all sorts of antidepressants that just made me feel worse, which included Wellbutrin that caused me to have basically constant panic attacks. Switched to another psychiatrist, and while she couldn't prescribe controlled meds as she's telehealth only, she referred me over to a doctor who put me on stims with no issue once he knew for sure I was diagnosed and didn't have any known heart problems.

And every time I fail out with another one, it‚Äôs so devastating and hopeless-making that it takes months, sometimes a full year before I‚Äôm able to try again. \n\nI don‚Äôt even know how to properly explain why it takes so long to get back up and try again. There‚Äôs so much executive functioning involved in searching your insurance network, calling around to find one who‚Äôs taking new patients, scheduling an appt for 2 months out cuz that‚Äôs the soonest they have, and then they all want to see for themselves that the non-stimulant drugs don‚Äôt work for you so you have to try them all yet again, each one being started at the lowest dose for a month, slowly tapering up each time you meet and then having to try being at the therapeutic dose for several months because that‚Äôs how long it can take to start working. \n\nThe last time I went down the list from my insurance company: several places were permanently closed, some weren‚Äôt taking new patients, one was pediatrics, one worked at a men‚Äôs inpatient drug & alcohol rehab, one one was taking new patients but only if you were seeing one of the therapists in his office, and none of the *therapists* were in network. ü´† \n\nFor someone who already struggles so much with organization, motivation, and executive functioning as a whole, this results in a full blown burnout every time yet another doctor fails me.

Some people depend on medication to literally stay alive in the case of some illnesses or disorders? In the case of ADHD, the medication often makes the difference between being able to function some-what okay, and not being able to function at all."

It's frustrating that these bad doctors prevent people from asking questions.\n\n\nAlso there's a difference between politely asking questions and harassing your doctor. It *should* be totally fine for OP to say \"hey I did some research and noticed we've only tried nonstimulant treatments when there are also many stimulant options that it seems are often more likely to be effective for ADHD. Can you talk me through the potential risks and rewards of these two categories and when it would be worth trying the other category? My insurance covers Focalin, Wellbutrin, and Adderall, so would any of those be worth considering?\"\n\n\nIt even should be fine for OP to say \"my friend with ADHD said she felt like Adderall was a big improvement compared to Wellbutrin, and Wellbutrin isn't working for me, so would trying Adderall be a reasonable next step?\"\n\n\n\nIt wouldn't be cool for OP to walk in and say \"yo doc, gimme 60mgs of Adderall XR right now!\"\n\n\nI think it's more about asking questions and treating each other as a teammate, but the doctor and the patient need to do that. A doctor who refuses to attempt the most common treatments (and can't explain why they're not recommended in this case) needs to get out of the healthcare field, because they're just making it harder for people to be healthy, especially if their justification is some garbage moral qualms or disbelief in science.

I was told to look for sleep disturbances in my baby. I was told that basically zero medications have extensive testing done on breastfeeding and pregnant people because nobody cares, and nobody would want to be part of a trial. That‚Äôs why they tell pregnant people not to take basically any medication, there just isn‚Äôt a definitive answer.\n\nMy doctor won‚Äôt let me take vyvanse right now and whenever I mention it I always have a bunch of people say that they‚Äôre taking it and breastfeeding. It all depends on the person and the risk. I think I‚Äôm not a good candidate for stimulants right now because both the baby and myself are super thin and I require a massive dose. So if my baby did get some it would probably have a negative effect on his weight.  Also I‚Äôm sure my provider is just in the group that believes it‚Äôs not something to risk. I bet I‚Äôm one of the first breastfeeding moms that he‚Äôs dealt with with this problem so he‚Äôs being cautious.

OP said the treatment they're on isn't working and their GP refuses to change things up. If what they've explained about the GP's ideas on stimulants and studying, it seems pretty clear that their training is questionable at best. OP isn't storming in there demanding what they want, but they have the right to say this treatment isn't working and demand to try a different approach. They also have the right to seek a second opinion of they're unhappy with the treatment options the first is offering them. If the current GP had given sufficient explanation as to why this process was so essential, it's unlikely they would be on reddit asking for opinions on what to do."

Then, around day 4 or 5, I started having nausea, a feeling something was stuck in my throat. This subsided once I had a bowel movement but my poops are pebbles (Type 1 on the Bristol Stool Scale). Since then, the nausea and throat sensation have rapidly subsided over two days. However, now I am preoccupied with my bowels. I don't know if I'm overthinking it, though. I have alternating IBS, so I may just be on the constipated side at the moment. I took some senna. I made the mistake of changing the time I take the medicine after only a few days so now my sensations while on it are all kinds of confused. Initially, it made me kind of somnolent but that was okay as I primarily felt calm more than sleepy. With switching to night time dosing, I now am having insomnia at night and sleepy during the day.\n\nWhat I would recommend is taking the medicine the same way at the same time each day. Stay at your current dose. Give yourself time to adjust to no caffeine. If you continue to struggle after 3 or 4 weeks total, then try reintroducing caffeine in small quantities. I still drink coffee, but I don't drink my second cup in the afternoon. I find the morning coffee is enough by itself. I just wish I didn't mess with the timing of the medication.\n\nAnyway, I am sticking with it. I am hopeful the side effects are temporary. I have had some major benefits in my sex life, my appetite, and my ability to sit and pay attention to people instead of zoning out. I just need the GI stuff to improve because I hate constipation."

I will stick to morning dosing, one cup of coffee in the morning, and as needed laxatives. Senna seems to have worked today as a reset, but I don't like the idea of a daily laxative so will try to avoid it as many days as possible.\n\nMy appetite was reduced to about 1/4 of what it was, so I am wondering if the sudden decrease in food intake as well as fluid intake made everything worse for me.

My libido was crazy, my ability to just be productive at-will was perfect, and the ability to avoid overeating was great. The productivity has tanked since but I think it is 100% the GI issues and messing with the timing of doses. Today, with everything calming down, I feel the productivity coming back up. Woke up at 3am which means some fatigue, but overall, still able to function at work and home. The same amount of sleep without the medicine would have led to getting to work barely on time,waking up just before i have to go, and severe irritability either towards others or more likely, myself internally. I also felt an urge to workout and got several thousand steps in before work and  at my seated office job.\n\nRelated to the GERD, that's the weird thing to me. It feels like it produces a gerd-like sensation. Then, if I eat anything, it rapidly goes away upon swallowing food. It seems to only be a problem when I sit, standing or even laying down its fine. It doesn't get better with antacids and I have only rare heartburn in my history. The nausea also barely improved with Zofran. So, then I wonder if its a gastric motility or constipation issue as having a bowel movement helps and Senna last night helped a lot this morning after a few bowel movements. On Monday, it was at its most severe. I went nuclear and ate super spicy curry which actually relieved severe nausea and severe GERD immediately and especially when I had a bowel movement a few hours later. Of course, the three days prior ending on Sunday my appetite was minimal. The better I understand this the better I can advise patients is my hope."
